You are now ready to felt your fishy. Place him in a mesh bag in your washing machine; set on extra small load and hot water, and add a tiny pinch of laundry detergent. Start the machine. Check every five minutes or so until it reaches the desired level of felting. (Be careful not to let it go through the spin cycle or he may get creases). Remove him from the bag and set him somewhere warm to dry. When he is dry, stuff him firmly with catnip, and sew him shut with matching thread. You may also need to secure any seams with needle and thread that did not completely close during felting. (See Figure 3). If you would like to add eyes and a mouth – and plan to supervise kitty while playing – you can embroider these on. I used French knots for eyes and running stitch for the mouth using CC. (See Figure 4)."],

He is without ornamentation for kitty safety, felted for durability and filled with catnip. He is a super easy knit, made in one piece and requiring only knowledge of knit and purl, increase and decrease. Please feel free to attach a stick and string to Cheddar if you would prefer one of those “fishing” type cat toys! Gauge is listed pre-felting. Other notions needed: darning needle, sewing needle, matching thread, catnip (5-10 grams)",
