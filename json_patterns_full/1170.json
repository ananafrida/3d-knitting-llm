  "full_text": "THIS PATTERN IS NOW AVAILABLE IN DANISH! Danish Translation About Earlier this week, I received a request from a nurse in Denmark who asked if I could create a pattern for a nurse-style doll that she could share with her coworkers. These dolls are my gift to her, and were created with great respect and gratitude for all of the medical professionals who are working so tirelessly to keep us safe during this difficult time. Construction Nurse Mates Dolls are knit in one piece from the bottom-up. The doll’s body can be knit flat on straight needles and seamed, or knit in the round on dpns. The optional face mask is knit flat on two needles. Simple sewing techniques are used to define the arms and legs after knitting. Gauge Exact gauge is not important;Choose a needle 2 or 3 sizes smaller than recommended on the ball band to create a dense fabric that will keep the stuffing hidden EXCITING NEWS! This pattern is now available in Italian thanks to Michela (LaMickey) for the translation.",
