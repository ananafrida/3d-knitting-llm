  "full_text": "This pattern is very much a schematic. Best approached as a puzzle. Have you knitted lots of entrelac? Have you read a lot of Barbara Walker books? Have you read a lot of Elizabeth Zimmerman? Do you like to figure things out? I welcome contributions to this pattern. I am good at making drawings and diagrams, and bad at creating narrative directions. Update: I found a few errors in the diagram. Probably not show-stoppers, but if you have downloaded the first version, please replace the PDF file with the one that contains “ver. 1.1” in the name.",
