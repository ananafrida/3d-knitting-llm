  "full_text": "There is a permanent KAL for sniffers at once and ready so if you need more inspiration, just zip by. Photos are highly appreciated, there has grown a kind of sniffer community meanwhile :) Simple instructions for breaking down leftovers :) Ideal for sock yarn, but also suitable for thicker types of wool. Simple pattern to eat yarn leftovers. Perfect for sock yarn as well as others. For English notes… just scroll down, English patterns can be downloaded now! This trumpet sniffer would like to use up all your leftover sock yarn, wear a few old buttons on his head and would love to delight (big and) small children with them; He also likes to look into the colorful world from the bazaar tables :))) Creativity is required, individualize your sniffer! Give it different eyes, different ears, decorate it with bows, hang a bell around its neck, tie a fluffy tail on it... I'm looking forward to many different project photos :))) These instructions can be used for charitable purposes (selling the trumpet sniffer at bazaars, etc.). Please note: button eyes and similar variants are not suitable for small children; sewn-on felt or fabric eyes would be better for this, or simply embroidered on :) More photos (in other colors, including body blanks) can be found in the associated project here English pattern is available now! This trumpet sniffer would love to eat all your yarn leftovers, wear some old buttons on his head and then please (not only) kids; it also loves watching people while sitting on charity sales :))) Creativity is in demand! Pimp your sniffer! Create different eyes, different ears, decorate it with bows, fix a bell around his neck, attach a pompon tail… I am looking forward to your creative project photos :))) This pattern is for private use only, but the trumpet sniffer can be sold for charity purposes (at bazaars or fairs). Attention: please consider that button eyes are not suitable for babies, for smaller kids you should rather sew on felted eyes or just sew a few stitches in contrasting color! More photos (detailed body basics and ears) are shown in the related project of mine.",
