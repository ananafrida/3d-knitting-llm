  "description": "We recently went on a Norwegian Cruise Ship. Apparently it is a “thing” to hide and find little ducks on the ship. My 5 year old granddaughter was understandably excited about this. I decided to knit some and ended up with about 20 to hide. I couldn’t find a pattern that had everything I liked, so worked out my own. Here it is. P.S. The adults on the ship seemed more excited about finding knitted ducks than the kids did!",

The adults on the ship seemed more excited about finding knitted ducks than the kids did! This probably isn’t a great beginner pattern as it has some techniques a beginner might not know - Judy’s Magic Cast On, working in the round, wrap and turns, closing with kitchener and picking up stitches. But it’s a very quick little knit and I had fun making the little ducks. For DK yarn and 3.0 mm needle, about 4-5 grams of yarn needed. If you use Worsted and 3.5 mm needle, about 7 grams needed.",
