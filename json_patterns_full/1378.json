  "full_text": "The fairy village of Cypress Knee is famous for its bright colored doors. Little Folk travel far and wide to take photos near their favorites. These thumb-sized fairy doors are a super, quick knit. They are knit in the round on dpns. Because they have a front and a back they don’t need blocking. Their wooden frames and brass door knobs are done with simple embroidery. I have decided to make these free. Please make as many as you like and feel free to make them to sell :) Happy Knitting! Natasha Praise for Colorful Fairy Doors Fun!! Very quick and easy project! ( MinniStitcher ) Super Quick Well written w/ links to embroidery tutorials. ( RandyRatCraft ) Quick knit.
