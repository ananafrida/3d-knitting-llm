  "full_text": "Made for an online friend who wanted one. Everyone seems to make the Teleport bracelet from Cygnus Alpha, but I wanted to be different. There was a very clear picture of Avon’s teleport bracelet in the episode Deliverance , and, since my friend and I are Avon fans, I decided to use that one instead. I’ve tried to be as true to the original design as possible given the restraints of the medium. You can make this pattern larger by adding stitches to the middle of the pronged silver bar. If you use this pattern and/or improve on it, please comment. I’d love to see a picture of your work!",
