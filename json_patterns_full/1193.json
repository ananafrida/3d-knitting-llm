  "full_text": "Description from website: Introducing William, the cute and cuddly knitted Snowman. It’s guaranteed that the children will love him to bits and no doubt he will find a home in the toybox instead of being stored away in the Christmas box. I’m sure that knitters will also enjoy his company, re-creating lots of Williams all year round. Real life snowmen are fun for a while, but they always melt away. William is a friend forever and a snowman for all seasons. I can never resist giving my dolls rosy cheeks - including snowmen! Measurement: 24cm (9½in) high, not including the bobble on his cap",
