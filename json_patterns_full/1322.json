  "full_text": "ERRATA: Row 11 should read K5, not K4. I will edit the .pdf and release an update as soon as I can! A super fun stuffed “bomb” - perfect for throwing at those that are irritating you… Finished size is between a baseball and softball, depending on how generous you are with your stuffing. Gauge is not critical to this project. Please note, if you use a larger size needle, you need to go up in yarn weight - a smaller needle helps keep the stuffing inside, without gaps. A small amount of crochet knowledge is helpful, though not necessary - you can always substitute a small icord for the crochet chain that is the fuse. This is not a huge project - I got about 7 bombs out of a skein of Vanna’s Choice.",
