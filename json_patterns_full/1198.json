  "full_text": "This is the seventh in a series of twelve linked patterns for a knitted wreath, to be published daily in December 2013. These fir cones add some texture to the wreath; they are a knitted strip, shaped with short rows and then rolled up and sewn to make the cone shape. A picot cast off in a lighter shade gives them that distinctive edge. You can use various shades of brown for your fir cones or, for a frosted effect, you could work the cast off row with cream yarn. There are two sizes of cones in this pattern, the big ones are about 4 cm long and the small ones 3 cm. 40g of yarn will make about a dozen fir cones. All my ravelry patterns are free to download but, if you enjoy them, please consider making a donation to the British Liver Trust where the money will go to fund research and support the families of children with a liver disease. You can do this easily by going to my fundraising page here Happy Knitting!",
