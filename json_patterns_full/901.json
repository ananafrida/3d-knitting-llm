  "full_text": "Glückskind is a baby blanket made from Merino HighTwist. This yarn is soft, machine washable on the wool cycle and therefore great for our baby. The blanket is started in the middle and knitted outwards using increases and different patterns. This makes the blanket square and the same length on all sides. After washing (in the machine) my blanket is 80 cm square. Just right for the little lucky child.",
