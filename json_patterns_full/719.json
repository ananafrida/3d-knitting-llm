  "full_text": "I have seen a few hats similar but most of what i saw had a lot of stitches to cast on and knit and I’m not the best or fastest knitter out there so wanted a smaller number to knit. using my pattern your finished item will fit ages roughly 3 months to 3 or 4 years as it has great stretch from the ribbing as shown in photos knowledge of kitchener stitch is advised but not essential This was previously a paid pattern but due to the new EU VAT laws i have decided to make all of my patterns free from now on as I don’t want to jump through hoops with the VAT and i don’t want my patterns to be extinct.",
