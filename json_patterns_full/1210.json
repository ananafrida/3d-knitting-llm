  "full_text": "NOTES -When knitting very small versions of this pattern it is much easier to use a left leaning decrease such as k2tbl, ssk, or skp than k2t. -Having just finished one for an upcoming craft sale, I have also discovered that a one-knot french knot makes a smaller, neater eye. -Scarf option: make a foundation chain 50 chains long. Tie each end in a knot. Instant scarf! -See “Icy” in my projects for an example of the above modifications.",
