  "description": "This is a lightweight version of Alberta summer that’s perfect for sunny days. It can be made with any fingering weight yarn, or a marled effect can be achieved with two strands of lace weight held together. It has a classic T-shirt fit with about 2 inches of positive ease and a hem that hits at mid hip. The lace pattern at the yoke is a variation of the one in Alberta Summer, but is more open and has the option to be knit with just a single strand of lace weight yarn for a more delicate effect. The orange sample was made with two strand of lace yarn held together and a single strand in the lace at the yoke.",

This is a good project for a beginner sweater knitter as the lace is very simple and there’s minimal shaping. German short rows are used to lower the front neckline.",
