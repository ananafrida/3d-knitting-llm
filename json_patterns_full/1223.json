  "full_text": "Knit in Cascade Sunseeker, LaPrawnda is a sparkly little shrimp who makes a nice guard for your stash, a gift for a friend, or a welcome addition to a knitted seafood salad. LaPrawnda can be knit at any gauge-- use super bulky to make a jumbo shrimp, or sock yarn for a tiny baby prawn. (Using size 3 needles and DK yarn, LaPrawnda is about 2” from tail to nose.) Adjust your needle size according to whichever yarn you choose- I suggest going down two or three needles sizes from what your yarn recommends. This way, you will get a nice, firm fabric that will hold stuffing well. Once you’ve made LaPrawnda, don’t forget to make her husband Shawn and perhaps some of their spawn!",
