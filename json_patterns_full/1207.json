Construction Friendly M.D. Dolls are knit in one piece from the bottom-up. The doll’s body can be knit flat on straight needles and seamed, or knit in the round on dpns. The optional face mask is knit flat on two needles. Details are added with duplicate stitch and simple sewing techniques are used to define the arms and legs after knitting.
