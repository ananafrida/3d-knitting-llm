The piece is started at the back, then stitches are picked up along the shoulders for the fronts. Once the back and front is knitted the Sweater joins in the round for the body. Lastly the turtle neck is worked in the round from the neck edge and stitches are picked up for the sleeves. Knit a swatch to determine which needle size you need to achieve the correct gauge – note that this can vary from yarn to yarn. Take care to wash the swatch before measuring. Size guide (XXS) XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL Bust circumfence: (75-80) 81-85 (86-90) 91-95 (96-100) 101-110 (111-120) 121-130 The Butterscotch Pullover is designed to have approx. 15 - 18 cm of positive ease, meaning the sizes above are designed to achieve a finished garment of 95 100 (105) 110 (115) 125 (135) 145 cm. Measure yourself with a measuring tape around your bust (or your widest upper body part) to determine which size will fit you the best. For example, if you measure 88 cm around the widest part on your upper body you should knit a size S. A size S sweater has a bust circumference of 104 cm = 15 cm positive ease.
