  "full_text": "My first published pattern. In the process of designing and knitting a baby cardigan pattern, I decided to make a matching hat pattern that looked a little different. This is actually knitted with less than half a 50 gram skein of leftover sock yarn. It is easy to increase size…just add 12 stitches to the given number to go up a size. I just haven’t tested it with live babies yet. My niece is having a baby in November so hope to have modeled photos soon.",
