In Part 2, you will seam one side and gather together the other two. Stuff and you have a ball with swirling colors! The pattern is written so that you can print copies and give your friends (or customers) the first part of the KAL without revealing the final result. The second page/clue gives the finishing instructions and reveals the mystery. Fingering weight yarns produce a nice ornament for your Christmas decorations. Substitute heavier yarns and larger needles to make toy balls or household decorations.",
