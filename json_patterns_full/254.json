  "full_text": "Cheddar is a goldfish cat toy. Yes, that kind of goldfish, the ones Pepperidge Farm makes. He is without ornamentation for kitty safety, felted for durability and filled with catnip. He is a super easy knit, made in one piece and requiring only knowledge of knit and purl, increase and decrease. Please feel free to attach a stick and string to Cheddar if you would prefer one of those “fishing” type cat toys! Gauge is listed pre-felting. Other notions needed: darning needle, sewing needle, matching thread, catnip (5-10 grams)",
