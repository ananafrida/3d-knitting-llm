  "full_text": "This is a fun little project that will use up those scraps in your stash. The eyeball is filled with a 22” small Pilates ball. I knit this the day following my LASIK surgery. It just seemed like the thing to do: therapy, as it were. I used my small Pilates ball as the support inside, inflating it just before I knit the final rows to close it up.",
