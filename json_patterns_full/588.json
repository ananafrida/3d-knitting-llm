  "description": "Inspired by the beautiful blankets I saw online and with a basket full of very small scraps of my hand-dyed yarns, I made my own version of a pattern that has already been written and passed on by many. By combining the often busier, speckled yarn with a solid color as a base, it becomes a peaceful whole. Described here as a baby blanket but you can make the blanket as small or as big as you want and also from any yarn/yarn thickness. Let your imagination run wild and knit your own unique domino blanket!",
