  "full_text": "A very simple, highly customisable dice tray or journal protector. A gift from one critter to another, this tray was inspired by Saphir, my own character and my love of playing D&D with friends. This can be knitted using any yarn you like, we’re holding two strands of DK yarn together here, but you could use anything you have on hand. Testers used various alternatives, 3 strands of Sport weight held together, 4 strands of Fingering weight held together. You can be very playful! Recommended yarn: Any Aran weight yarn. Sample uses: DK weight yarn (Holding 2 strands together), e.g., Heather & Hops Highland Merino 100% Highland Wool 100g - 225m / 246yds There are many affordable or more luxurious yarn options: don’t be afraid to experiment with your stash. Recommended needles: 6.5 mm US 10.5 circular needles in suitable length for your preferred method of working both flat and short circumferences in the round. e.g. 60 cm / 24 inch cable for magic loop. Needle size is suggested. Gauge is not particularly important but will impact the final size of your scroll. Gauge: 23 sts and 12 rows over 4 inch by 4 inch / 10 cm by 10 cm in seed stitch. Measurements: This pattern is highly customisable as noted in the easy modifications. Width: 21.5 cm / 8.5 inches Length: 16.5 cm / 6.5 inches Height: 2.5 cm / 1 inch Notions: Stitch markers and tapestry needle to weave in ends. Yardage: Main colour: Holding two strands together, with a tie. 52 g / 120 m / 131 yds total or 26g / 60 m / 65 yds of each strand of DK weight yarn. Yardage may vary depending on yarn choice, gauge variations or modifications. This is not tech-edited but has been tested by a few amazing knitters!
