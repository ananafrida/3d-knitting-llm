  "full_text": "One thing about me is that I love a quick project. Especially when that project is a present for a friend! Last week, my BFF let me know her sister had a baby, and I knew I had to cast on a project for him. I’ve recently been in love with garter ribbing, it’s so stretchy and the garter ridges add a nice little detail. So I thought… why don’t I just cast on a garter rib hat and see where the wind takes me? I know Kate and Courtney have my back if something goes awry. Without further ado, here’s the pattern for the adorable Baby Hat I created! Worthy of Note This is a simple hat suitable for beginner knitters. The project is knit bottom-up, beginning with the garter ribbing. Specifications YARN Kelbourne Woolens Keystone (70% deadstock Acryilic, 30% N. American wool): 110 off white, 1 skein.
