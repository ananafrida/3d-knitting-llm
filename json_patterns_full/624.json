  "full_text": "This pattern was inspired by the fabulous, precious, hysterical Feline Dim Sum cat toys by Julie Falatko, found in the Spring 03 issue of Knitty. Julie wrote patterns for spring rolls and wontons. My favorite dim sum dish is steamed buns (bao zi), hands-down. Plus, the swirly ridges you sometimes see on the buns (especially the pork-filled ones that my favorite restaurant serves) where they are pinched together reminded me of the swirly ridges you get at the top of some hats. So when I decided to make Julie’s toys as a Christmas gift for my Step-aunt (loving owner of four cats), I couldn’t resist designing my own. Gauge is not critical for this pattern, as long as the fabric isn’t so loose that you can see the stuffing. Also Requires: batting or stuffing catnip catnip spray (optional) a yarn needle Add about 2 yards of a contrasting color yarn for different filling “flavors”. (See the pattern notes for variations.)",
