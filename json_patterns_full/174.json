  "full_text": "This ball pouch keeps your yarn together while knitting. You can put a cake in it, but it is also suitable for a hand-wound round ball. It will prevent your cake from falling apart or your ball of yarn from rolling all over the place. The pattern has 3 sizes, for a 10, 50 or 100 gram ball. You can use snaps for the closure, but you can also thread 1 or 2 drawstrings through the holes in the border. Tip: The pouch is also nice as a gift packaging for, for example, a pair of baby socks, a pack of tea or a bar of soap. This yarn ball buddy prevents your ball of yarn from collapsing or rolling around the place. You can put a yarn cake in, but also a hand wound round ball of yarn.
