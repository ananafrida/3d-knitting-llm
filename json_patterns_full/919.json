  "full_text": "The scarf is worked flat as a one-piece with nice built-in edges that do not curl. It is a great one-skein / scrap yarn / stash busting project that is quick to make. The repeating stitch pattern is very meditative and relaxing to knit. The length and width of the scarf are easily modified, you can make a cute little scarf or a wide cosy wrap. Skill Level: adventurous beginner.",
