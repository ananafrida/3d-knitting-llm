  "full_text": "This is a slightly cupped, ribbed poppy that is worked flat and has very tiny seams. It is very quick to work as the black centre “button” is knitted as part of the main (flat) piece, not added separately. My finished poppy is 5 cm across, when sitting in its slightly cupped shape. However, gauge isn’t too important as long as your knitting is firm enough for the poppy to hold its shape. It can be used as an accessory for a hat or jacket, or (if you are so inclined) you can use them for a community project, which is just what inspired me to create a knitted poppy that is quick to make and doesn’t take up a lot of your wool or time.",
