  "full_text": "A pair of quick, fun ghosts to brighten your Halloween tabletop, mantle, or workspace. Gus and Augustus add a spooky, fun ambiance alone, as a haunt (a group of ghosts), or try mixing them amongst mini-pumpkins, gourds and pine cones for a complete holiday tableau. Each ghost takes only ~2 hr to make. New to making stuffed toys? These ghosts are an easy and quick introduction to several basic toy construction principles. Hate weaving in ends? These toys are stuffed, meaning that the yarn tails can be pulled through the stuffing inside the toys, eliminating the need to weave in ends! Detailed instructions are provided for knitting and stuffing the ghosts, as well as adding the eyes, which are simply stitched on with a bit of contrasting yarn. Techniques used include knitting in the round, increasing and decreasing. Instructions are provided for knitting the ghosts in the round on double-point needles, but can easily be adapted for magic loop. Each ghost requires less than 50 yd (46 m) worsted-weight yarn. English and metric sizing is provided.",
