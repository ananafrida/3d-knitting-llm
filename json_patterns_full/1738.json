The Noventa yarn is incredibly soft and a real treat for everyone. One size fits most. Easy 3 x 2 ribbing and a fun decrease pattern at the top. You can find all the colors of Noventa at The Yarn Club, www.yarnclubknits.com . Errata: Row 9: K2tog, k1, p2, repeat from * to * until the last 5 stitches. K2tog, k1, p1, slip next stitch knitwise, remove marker, slip next stitch knitwise, k1, psso. replace marker after CDD. Update version 3 is correct. I also added some clarification to the measurements of the body of the hat.",
