  "full_text": "Astrid Lindgren (1907-2002) and Ilon Wikland (1930-) worked together on a number of classical children’s books, written by Astrid and illustrated by Ilon. The work of Astrid Lindgren is unique and significant, and her books have been translated to more than 100 languages and sold in more than 165 million copies around the world. Astrid Lindgren and Ilon Wikland began their collaboration in the mid-1950s at the publishing house Rabén & Sjögren. Together they created a magical world that has touched generations of readers and ensured that Astrid Lindgren’s stories continue to be loved all over the world. Järbo has now been granted the opportunity to create a unique collection of yarns and knitting kits with some of the most beloved children’s books characters as inspiration.
