  "full_text": "One of my favourite insects and gardeners’ friend (aphid enemy!) Ladybird or Ladybug? How do you say it? My lady has a small pebble inserted into the body so could be used as a paper-weight should the need arise and should she need a purpose!? If not, she’s fun to arrange in the house and out in the garden - ooh and I’d love to see a micro knit one (I’ve tried myself on 0.8mm needles but failed miserably!!) Within the pattern I’ve given lots of detailed instructions on how to add the wire legs - I used two x 26cm/ 10in long x 22 gauge ones - I’ve also linked to en Etsy shop from where I bought mine. Yarn-wise - I’ve used stash Drops Alpaca but you can use any 4-ply/ 3-ply (or finer if micro) yarn, and I knitted mine on 2mm needles. I hope you enjoy this little pattern and enjoy having her around the place! Claire xx",
