  "full_text": "Since hubby is a hard-core D&D geek, he has lots of dice. I decided that he needed a nifty bag to keep them in, so I made the red version . Then I decided I wanted it for my dice, and made the felted version for him. The smallest one was made for a set of 100 tiny 6-sided dice (4mm on a side) These would also work well in non-geek applications, and are great stashbusters – I didn’t use anywhere near a full skein for any of them. Gauge is not critical, but I have given mine as a reference. You can download the .pdf file here , or follow the link to my blog.",
