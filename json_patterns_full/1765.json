  "full_text": "When thinking about what I wanted to do for my first contribution to the year of hats, I took a bunch of elements of knitting I really, really love - a folded brim, textured stitches, stripes, and a pom pom - and incorporated them all into the design. Worthy of Note This hat begins with a provisional cast on , then a deep folded brim is worked in a K1, P1 Ribbing. Once the ribbing is complete, the provisional cast on is unpicked and placed on a spare circular needle and the stitches are joined to created a folded brim . After the brim is complete, the body of the hat is worked in a texture stripe pattern from a chart. The chart is worked 4 times around. Decreases shape the crown and a pom pom completes the look. Please Note: This is not a beginner pattern, but it is a great introduction to working from charts. Both the body of the hat and the crown decreases are worked from a chart.
