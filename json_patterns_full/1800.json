  "full_text": "This practical and elegant basket works up fairly quickly and is really easy to knit. It is worked top down, beginning at the top edge of the basket, similar in construction to my Easy Bubble Basket . There are several customizable options for sizing and details, too! There are two options for sizing this little basket, Small or Large. You may need a second skein of the bulky yarn if you make the larger size. It is worked to the desired height. Two sizes: small, 8” circumference, 12” tall, large, 10” circumference, 12” tall The Small basket is shown in photos. Linen stitch, which provides minimum stretch, is excellent for a basket like this. It’s perfect because you don’t want a basket to stretch! The materials you’ll need are pretty simple: A single skein of Lion Brand Wool-Ease Thick and Quick for Small, or two skeins for Size Large. Any colorway may be used, OR you can use another super bulky yarn, preferably with wool content A 18” - 24” circular knitting needle, or preferred method of working with a large circumference in the round A set of 2 dpns for the i-cord handles A large-eye yarn needle A pair of scissors If you downloaded this pattern while it was free for a limited time, thanks for supporting me - I was overwhelmed by all of the attention this pattern received but just recently decided to not charge any money for this design.
