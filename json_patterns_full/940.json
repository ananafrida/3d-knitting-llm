  "full_text": "Knit your own feather quill! Available in tail (symmetrical) and wing (unsymmetrical) versions, these knitted feathers have a lengthwise hollow to contain a pen or pencil. There are only two loose ends that need to be sewn in. Insert a pen or pencil into the hollow quill and stretch out the feather so that it is approximately flat. The feathers can also be blocked to show more of the ribbing. As with most ODDknit patterns, the yarn and needle sizes in the “you will need” section are just a guide. Feel free to improvise with whatever needles and yarn you have lying around - that’s half the fun! You will need: yarn that matches pen/pencil colour (dk weight) 3 x double ended knitting needles (3mm) pen or pencil tapestry needle scissors",
