Great as a dishcloth or washcloth or with other squares to form a blanket or afghan - could look great with my paw print square or other animal squares. Both chart and written pattern are included. Finished square (using DK yarn and 4 mm - US6, UK8 - needles) approximately 22 cm x 22 cm (8.5 inches x 8.5 inches) This square is the same size as my other free squares - together they could make a fantastic afghan!",
