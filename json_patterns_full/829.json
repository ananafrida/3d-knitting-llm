  "full_text": "The Judah Scarf is a simple and timeless ribbed scarf pattern that’s perfect for beginners and relaxing for experienced knitters. It features a 1x1 rib edge that transitions into a broken 1x1 rib for subtle texture, then finishes with a matching rib edge. Knit flat on size 7 (4.5mm) needles, it works up quickly and makes a great gift or winter accessory. You only need to know the knit and purl stitches to make this pattern! Tutorials for casting on, knitting, purling, and binding off are linked in the post. Free pattern available at https://amandammorse.com/the-judah-scarf-a-free-ribbed-scarf-pattern/",
