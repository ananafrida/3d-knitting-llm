  "full_text": "These adorable acorn streetlamps are sure to add whimsy and joy to your Christmas tree. They also look darling on a wreath or make a wonderful addition to a seasonal display! They are knit entirely in the round from the bottom up on dpns. The candle is made with simple embroidery and the ends stuffed inside. A handle is made using the cast off end and the pole is made with either a toothpick or a branch that slides into place. I have always loved streetlamps! How wonderful it must have been to see a lamplighter light them at sunset! Need a lantern that stands independently? See my Acorn Lantern pattern.",
