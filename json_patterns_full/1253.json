  "full_text": "#freebeefridayknits April Beginner’s Bunny; Rainbow Bunny; Easter Bunny; Stash-Busting Bunny; Quick Bunny; ——————————— Fill-in-the-Blanks Bunny… In other words, a bunny for everyone, using any yarn you have and any needles to suit. As I mentioned - it is primarily a bunny for beginners - so it’s written as such and although it still has all the context and techniques that I use in all my other patterns it is a very much simplified version. And I loved designing her/him - it took me back to when I first started #freebeefridayknits and that was a joy to go back there. I hope to see loads of these hopping around the place - it’ll be a free pattern for all time. Please do share yours here #imadethisrabbit on Instagram and here #Imadethisrabbit Facebook Page And if you’re a beginner then I’d love to know how you got on so please email me if you like. I’m getting a ‘beginner’s video tutorial’ sorted so look out for that! Finally - as I write this we’re all locked in so need our online communities more than ever and crafting has never meant so much - so … Happy (bunny) Knitting!!",
