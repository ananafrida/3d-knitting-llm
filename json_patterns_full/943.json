  "full_text": "A very easy pattern I came up with when I realized how yucky the bath toys are when left to sit! This is supposed to be quite stretchy, so gauge is unimportant. The large needles make it nice and airy to help dry things out quicker. I used a large ball of the Handicrafter yarn and used about 1/3 of it. I have hung it in the bath using Command hooks and the kids love it!",
