  "full_text": "I was alittle disappointed that knitted wands had not already been done. But I wanted something for my daughter’s Harry Potter theme birthday. This is my harry potter wand. Right now, I used straws within straws as the base but my little 3 year old proved quickly that I need to beef it up alittle or they will all end up like Ron’s. It is nice and soft and knitted up real quick. I think I will just stuff the tip with stuffing to prevent injuries. This one measures 10 inches, but I think I will have fun being a wandmaker. Maybe add a feather, glitter or crystal to the core for more make believe fun. I used 4 strands of yarn so I think I am going to try using more then one color to add depth and the stitching can be twisted in different ways to make it look more organic. I would love to see your designs, so please post pictures. Hope you enjoy becoming a wand maker!",
