The role played by western states,the complicity of corporations and of various institutions make this case a very special one. The fact that Israel actually benefits from violating international law and receives ¨red carpet¨ from the West means that we all have a role to play in ending the injustice that the Palestinians are facing. The injustice in Palestine has ramifications throughout the world. (…)Exploring the palestinian case is therefore crucial for understanding where we stand as human beings and what we stand for. Finding a solution to this question could then open the door to a new vision, to a new world, to new possibilities for all of us.” F. Barat 2014,introduction to N.Chomsky & I. Pappé “On Palestine”. Knit this little flag to stand for justice, to stand for the future of oppressed young people and children.",
