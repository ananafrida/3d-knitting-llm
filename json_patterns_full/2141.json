  "full_text": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The yarn used in the sample was HELD DOUBLE THROUGHOUT to achieve the stated gauge. Other worsted weight yarns, such as HiKoo Simpliworsted and HiKoo CoBaSi, would make excellent single-strand substitutions; they would also require less yardage. This is my adaptation, one of many, based on the excellent and legendary original Five-Hour Baby Sweater/Jacket pattern. For the history/background of that pattern, see the first column in which I plan the project. The optional embroidery was done with Schoppell-Wolle Edition 6 yarn. Full notes on it are included in the “Fridays with Franklin” series via the pattern link. My adaptation does not include buttonholes, but substitutes a single loop closure. This and other changes are all outlined in detail in the column itself.",
