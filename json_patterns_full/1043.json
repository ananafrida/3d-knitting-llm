  "full_text": "DESCRIPTION The DIY (Design It Yourself) Raglan pattern is a V-neck tee knit seamlessly from the top down in stockinette, featuring a compound raglan, thoughtful shaping, and optional adjustments for fuller busts and arms. The piece begins flat to shape the V-neck, then joins in the round to complete the yoke. After separating the body and sleeves, each is knit individually. Advanced knitters will find guidance for customizing neckline and hem finishes, and for substituting textured stitches, lace, or colorwork in the body. Treat this pattern as a blank canvas and design your own unique raglan tee! SIZE This pattern is designed with 7-15cm positive ease around the bust and at least 3cm positive ease around the bicep. upper chest circumference 75-147cm bust circumference 75-155cm (FBA +5cm) upper arm/bicep circumference up to 27-51cm (SA +5cm) See size chart in image! OPTIONAL ADJUSTMENTS There are 3 optional adjustments available in this pattern. You may employ any combination of these adjustments, according to your needs and preferences. Full Bust Adjustment (FBA) FBA is recommended if your bust circumference exceeds the range accounted for the selected size. FBA adds 5cm to the finished bust circumference. See sizing chart for more details. FBA involves the addition of vertical bust darts that are worked near the side body seam, after the sleeves and body have been separated. Bust Short Rows (BSRs) BSRs are horizontal bust darts worked after the body and sleeves have been separated. BSRs are recommended for those with a bust cup depth of more than 5cm. Sleeve Adjustment (SA) Recommended for those who want a larger sleeve circumference, SA adds 5cm to the finished sleeve circumference. GAUGE 24 sts and 32 rounds = 4” (10cm) in stockinette with 3.5mm needles, washed and blocked WHAT YOU NEED Any sport/fingering weight yarn that meets gauge.
