  "full_text": "This is the 35th in a series of 50 patterns for a knitted sampler blanket, to be published weekly throughout 2018. The blanket is made up of 48 squares, a border and an edging, each featuring a different stitch pattern or technique so the whole project is a masterclass in knitting. As well as written instructions, charts are included for each of the squares. This ‘Moss Stitch Rib’ looks very similar to Mistake Stitch Rib and is very simple to knit. Like most ribs, it is reversible and lies flat. All my ravelry patterns are free to download but, if you enjoy them, please consider making a donation to the British Liver Trust where the money will go to fund research and support the families of children with a liver disease. You can do this easily by going to my fundraising page here Happy Knitting!",
