  "full_text": "Since I’ve often wished for a book of instructions for basic shapes, that I could take and make my own, but I haven’t yet found this book, I decided to get the ball rolling myself and create a simple ball pattern that allows for infinite play and variation. Use this pattern as a jumping off point to try out balls with color work, different stitch patterns etc. This is actually 2 patterns in one: instructions for a ball knit flat, and a ball knit in-the-round. That way you can choose which works best for you. Enjoy! gauge, size and specific yarn are not too important, since this ball pattern is made to be played around with, but I do suggest you knit with a combination of yarn and needle that knits up a firm, tight fabric, so that the ball holds its shape and stuffing doesn’t leak out.",
