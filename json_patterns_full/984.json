  "full_text": "Knit some Rainbows as badges, jewellery, bag charms, to hang from mobiles, or to make a rainbow pride banner. I have added toy filling to make a puffy rainbow, but you could leave your rainbow free of stuffing so it lies flatter if you prefer. Designed by Amanda Berry @fluffandfuzz, the rainbow is knitted on single pointed needles (not in the round). My rainbow was knitted in acrylic 4 ply yarns, although you can use DK (double knitting/light worsted) if you prefer. NEEDLES A pair of 3.25mm single pointed knitting needles (US 3). RECOMMENDED YARN Patons Baby Smiles Fairytale Fab 4 Ply; sport/fingering weight; 100% acrylic; a few metres in each shade. NOTIONS Tapestry needle and a small handful of toy filling or cotton wool ball to stuff. SIZES One size only - 8cm wide x 5cm tall. TECHNIQUES For beginners and above, other techniques used include a little seaming and a k2tog decrease. PATTERN INFO This knitting pattern is a pdf download, 1 page, and written in English.
