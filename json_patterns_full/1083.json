  "full_text": "The Town Square Sweater is a top-down drop-shoulder textured sweater featuring ribbing, i-cords, and a lovely grid texture. This pattern has been tech edited and test knit in all sizes. Matching made-to-measure pet sweater pattern included! Each of my designs will be a “hand-knit postcard”, inspired by one of my favorite places. My town square has long been one of my favorite spots to knit, and I can’t imagine of a better location for my first sweater. Sizing Recommended ease: 11-15” // 28-38cm Sizes: 1, 2, (3, 4), 5, 6 To fit bust sizes: 30-34”, 35-39”, (40-44”, 45-49”), 50-54”, 55-59” // 75-85cm, 88-99cm, (100-112cm, 113-124cm), 125-139cm, 140-150cm Approximate garment bust size: 45”, 50”, (55”, 60”), 65”, 70” // 113cm, 125cm, (138cm, 150cm), 163cm, 178cm Gauge 20st/26rows per 10cm/4” in 2x2 rib, knit flat. Be sure to block your gauge swatch, as this texture will relax quite a bit during the blocking process Materials Yarn: worsted weight Yarn quantity: 1050, 1220, (1390, 1560), 1730, 1900 yards // 960, 1115, (1270, 1425), 1580, 1740 meters Blue sample used Wool and the Gang’s Shiny Happy Cotton in color Cloudy Blue Orange sample used Cascade 220 in color Ginger Needles: 4.5mm/US7 and 3.75mm/US5 This sweater was originally inspired by a retail sweater by the brand The Knotty Ones. Over time, it’s truly evolved and taken on a life of its own. I hope you enjoy this pattern as much as I enjoyed making it! See you at the town square, - Liz This is a free pattern, but you can show support by liking, queueing, and adding projects! Tech editing by @aurora.marlowe",
