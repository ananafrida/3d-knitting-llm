  "full_text": "Some day in November 2013 I stood in front of my DVD and BluRay collection with a problem: Out of my favorite shows, which one should I watch? I had no clue and decided to make some kind of “decision helper”, I’m a crafter, so this should be easy. Quite quickly the inspiration fairy hit and one word made its way out of my mouth: Dice! I knew that I didn’t want the thing to be too big, 30x30 stitches had to be enough and I chose to knit the thing. So I fired up my fancy chart design tool (… well, I clicked on the Excel icon…) and started thinking of symbols, that stand for shows, superheros, characters, fractions… the next days, I made up enough charts for 8 or 9 dice of different topics: DC Superheroes (Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Superman, Batman, Martian Manhunter) Marvel Characters (Hulk, Iron Man, Black Widow / Hawkeye, Captain America, Thor, Loki, Spiderman, Deadpool) TV Shows (Sherlock, Dr Who, Star Trek, Babylon 5, Supernatural, Firefly) Movie Franchises (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Potter, Bond, Alien, Hunger Games) Starkid Productions (AVPM, AVPS, B@man, Starship, MAMD - waiting for something twisted :D) Star Wars Symbols (Empire, Rebellion, Jedi, Sith, Mandos, Seps) my fav Books (In the making) you see, some of them are not “decision helpers” but just for fun. This Pattern is for the Movie Franchise Version of the cube. With a size 4,5 (US 7) needle and my favourite cotton yarn, the size is 13x13x13 cm (5x5x5 inches) The DC and Marvel Comics Versions are already online in my ravelry store. The pdf file contains charts for: Star Wars Imperial Symbol Tolkiens Logo (Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit) Harry Potter’s Deathly Hallows Symbol the Mockingjay Logo from the Hunger Games The Wayland Yutani Logo from Alien 007 Writing for James Bond Jurassic Park Matrix Men in Black The Skynet Logo from Terminator Pirates of the Caribbean Skull an empty chart so you can design your own logo The dice turned out so cute and cuddly, that it would also make a cool toy for toddlers and kids. So if you are a geek parent, you know what to do :) I don’t own the copyrights to any of the Logos, those belong to the studios and distributors. I’m just a fan. Enjoy",
