  "full_text": "Summary Knit in 10 (or 12) sections, cast-on and bind-off edges are sewn together From the pattern This ball comes out 4” to 4 1/2” in diameter, about the size of a grapefruit. The needles are small for the size of the yarn. This makes a dense fabric so the filling won’t show through. (Variations for a 2” to 2 1/2” ball are given at the end of the pattern.) Additional materials needed: Polyester fiber filling or old nylon stockings or other stuffing material darning needle to sew up edges Gauge is not important for this pattern: use any yarn you want and needles that will give you a firm, dense fabric, but be prepared for a different sized ball.",
