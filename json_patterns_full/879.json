  "full_text": "You: “I need to make a baby blanket.” Me: “When is the baby shower?” You: “2 weeks from today!” Me: “I have just the kit for you.” We’ve just put together our latest kit, Sliding is Fun! A baby blanket, perfect for the stroller or car seat. 26” x 29” Soft and cozy. We machine wash and dry this yarn on delicate in a SOAK Eco Wash Bag . One skein each of Juniper Moon Farms Cumulus Rainbow and Solid . 94% cotton with a touch of nylon for strength. Knit on a US8 needle, this blanket knits up fast. It’s just the knit stitch, but we slide the stitches to the opposite end of the needle to work the next color, creating a stockinette stitch section between each ridge. We love how this shows off the gradient color in such a fun way. We hope you love our color combinations as much as we do. Click here to see all available kits. The Ravelry download includes two copies of the pattern. Please feel free to share with a friend!!",
