  "full_text": "The pattern is available free on my blog. The felted pod can be made with any feltable yarn and appropriate sized double-pointed needles. The pattern is written for a set of 8mm needles and two strands of wool held together - approximately an 8ply and a 12ply. For two 8plys together I generally use 7mm needles. I’ve also made them with a single strand and 4.5mm needles. Gauge doesn’t really matter, just choose needles that make your knitting a bit on the looser side.",
