The balls can be made with one or more colors, so this is a great chance to use up your skaps. The small balls are great to tie on the top of a gift for a baby shower instead of using a bow. The balls are made using short rows, and if you are using multiple colors you start the new color in the repeat of row 1. There are 10 repeats, so you can use up to ten colors.
