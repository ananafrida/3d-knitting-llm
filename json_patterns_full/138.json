  "full_text": "Pattern gives Instructions to make a 6x6 inches Aran (worsted weight), 5x5 inches DK (sport weight), 4x4 inches 4Ply (fingering weight) cube. This knitted cube toy is an ideal project for a beginner to make. It is simple & easy to knit & embroider. Each letter and picture motif is duplicate stitch embroidered (UK Swiss Darn) onto a single colour knitted square. To ensure the finished cube has flat stable sides & keeps its shape I suggest using foam precut to the required size inside rather than loose stuffing. This is a simple and delightful toy that any precious new arrival will treasure, love & have many hours of fun with over the years.
