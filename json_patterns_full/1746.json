  "description": "This hat was created for my boyfriend to keep him warm on those chilly early mornings heading to the bakery. The fold-up brim is knit in 1x1 ribbing with a singular knit row to make a tidy fold, and it’s finished with a beautiful square decrease. I used berroco ultra alpaca in ‘tiger’s eye mix’ and ‘moonshadow’.",
