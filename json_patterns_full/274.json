Video coming very soon! If your cat likes these half as much as my cat does, you will be pleased! With the features both the cat and I like: right size, weight and texture (picky cat!) a little bump on one side and a “tail” on the other for easy throwing—nice if your cat likes to play fetch. But most important, since little toys seem to get lost as soon as they are finished, it is streamlined into a quick, 10 minute knit. I does not actually look like a mouse by any stretch of the imagination, but my cat doesn’t seem to mind. Stuff it with catnip, yarn scraps, toy stuffing, or any combination of the above. Stripes obviously optional! Change yarn weight, and needle size accordingly, to knit bigger toys.",
