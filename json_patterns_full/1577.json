  "full_text": "The fall feels are here…crisp air-breathing, pumpkin spice latte- drinking, chunky wool handknit-wearing days! We knitters can’t wait for these cooler days and nights, with all the knitting inspiration they bring! To celebrate fall, I’ve added my own Tinker Creek Handknits knitting pattern to the website….featuring KNIT PUMPKINS, because I’m obsessed with them! They’re made from Cascade 220 Superwash yarn in the colorway Pumpkin (822). I used all natural materials to stuff them (cotton and/or wool) and decorate them. Cinnamon sticks work great for the stem of the pumpkin. I tucked in wild berries and fall flowers around the stem. From this pattern, you can create SO many variations … for example, add or subtract rounds to make them taller or smaller. Adjust the stuffing to make them plumper, if you like. Tie a ribbon around the stem. It’s up to you! Sizes: Small, Medium and Large I used double pointed needles in Size 6 (4 mm). Pattern Skills: cast on, working in the round, increases, decreases, knit and purl.",
