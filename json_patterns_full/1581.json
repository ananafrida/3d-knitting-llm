  "full_text": "The Bulky Textured Cowl pattern features a simple design with a fun, textured stitch pattern interspersed throughout. Knit on size US 15 (10 mm) needles and with super bulky yarn, it is a quick knit that can be made in just one afternoon-- great for a special loved one or anyone on your gift list that wants to stay warm! Although the pattern is written for one size that will fit most people, there are directions in the pattern for how to modify the stitch pattern for additional sizes. Gauge recommended in the pattern can be achieved with a single strand of super bulky yarn or with four strands of worsted or three strands of aran weight held together, making it great for using up those small leftovers in your stash.",
