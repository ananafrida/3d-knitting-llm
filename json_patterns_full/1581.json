This is an intermediate pattern which includes working in the round, increases and decreases, provisional CO, and I-cord. I prefer the two circular method of knitting in the round, but you may use DPNs or Magic Loop if you prefer.",

I prefer the two circular method of knitting in the round, but you may use DPNs or Magic Loop if you prefer. 10/25/2013 - most of you figured out the small error, but it’s now been corrected. 11/19/2016 - After making several of these I’ve discovered that decreasing a few rows at the bottom before filling and closing makes the close better for heavier yarn. I just decreased each rib down to 3 then down to 2 before ending. If you prefer you can do this on other weights as well. I’ll update the pattern soon.",
