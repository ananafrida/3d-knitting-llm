  "description": "I love the Geddy Tee and started mine immediately. However, I felt bad that my “knit-only” friends could not make one as well. I searched Ravelry for knitted squares and found the one designed by Betty Salpekar. It was close, but not quite a substitute for the Geddy Tee crocheted square. Betty graciously gave her permission for me to revise her square for my purposes. Here is the result. I also include a video that shows every step of the process.",

  "full_text": "I love the Geddy Tee and started mine immediately. However, I felt bad that my “knit-only” friends could not make one as well. I searched Ravelry for knitted squares and found the one designed by Betty Salpekar. It was close, but not quite a substitute for the Geddy Tee crocheted square. Betty graciously gave her permission for me to revise her square for my purposes. Here is the result. I also include a video that shows every step of the process. Materials needed Yarn Use the same yarn type as the body of your Geddy in different colors for each tier. I used Malabrigo Rios for my Geddy Tee and my crocheted squares, which is a bit heavier than the yarn used in the original pattern. The sample square uses 5 colors for 5 tiers. The sample was knit using Malabrigo Rios. Very small amounts of each color are used. The finished 5-round/4” square weighs 9 grams. The crocheted version also weighs 9 grams. Obviously, each new round takes a bit more yarn than the previous round. If making the Geddy Tee, refer to the pattern to determine what size squares you need and how many rounds. Needles 2 dpns in suitable size for project. Sample knit using size 6 dpns. Use needles that create a firm fabric for your square and yield the correct size for your tee. Tapestry needle for weaving in ends. I demonstrate in the video how to use very small gauge dpns to block the finished squares if needed. I pinned my squares and steamed them.",
