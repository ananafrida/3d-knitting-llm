  "description": "The perfect hat to knit for yourself or for someone you care about! This is my personal favorite hat – I have knit several of them for myself and for others, and it’s my go-to daily winter extra cozy hat. (The shape and fit are just right!) Knit this hat in a half hour using 100 grams of bulky yarn. (You can knit two hats from one 200 gram skein!) It’s easy to modify by adding or subtracting rows in the ribbed or stockinette section. Lickity split, quick little knit. Happy knitting! Please share your hats online by using the hashtag #jenshalfhourhat – I love seeing your projects!",
