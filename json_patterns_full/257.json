  "full_text": "Gauge 10x10 cm = 20 stitches x 24 rows The sample is knitted in double moss stitch, as shown in the chart on the page 3 . Use size 4 needles (I recommend circular needles with an 80 cm cord, but double-pointed needles can also be used). Size One size / Length: 140 cm (before washing: 112 cm, using Drops Air yarn) / Width: 12 cm. P.S. The length after washing may vary when using different yarn. Yarn Drops Air (65% alpaca, 28% polyamide, 7% wool; 50 g/150 m). You will need 50 g for this project. P.S. If you plan to use a different yarn, you may need slightly more. Drops Air is very light and airy, which is why the required amount is so small. Additional Materials Needed Circular needles size 4 (I recommend a 60/80 cm cord). Scissors. Measuring tape. Row counter. Tapestry needle with a rounded tip. Two markers.",
