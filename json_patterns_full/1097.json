  "full_text": "This sweater is worked top down using mega mohair. In this design we play with simplicity and happy knitting. Once the neckband is worked on small needles we are working on large needles and in a simple construction. Thus this pattern will be a lovely relaxation for the knitter. The increases are not the usual pair of raglan increases in four corners. Instead we work with a single increase. The line of increases will then perform a beautiful rounded line in the sweater.",
