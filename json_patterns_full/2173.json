  "full_text": "Dressing up, playing make-believe, pretending to be King, Queen, Prince, or Princess for a day, so many fun childhood memories involve games like these. Whether the crown was a paper hat, colored with crayons and markers, or a cardboard toy included with a kid’s meal, one thing is for sure, the wearer felt royal if only for a minute. Here is a simple pattern for a top-down knitted crown that is easy and quick to make. If you use a stretchy cast-on and bind-off, it will fit a wide range of sizes. The large fits a young teen, but also fits adult XL-sized heads. The small fits a wee toddler up through a young teen with a large-sized head. This can also be a great use for little scraps of brightly colored yarn, since each one uses a small amount.",
