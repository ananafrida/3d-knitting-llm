Patterns for two sizes are given and the finished feathers can be used as bookmarks or decorations. They would be popular with cats too.",

All my ravelry patterns are free to download but, if you enjoy them, please consider making a donation to the British Liver Trust where the money will go to fund research and support the families of children with a liver disease. You can do this easily by going to my fundraising page here Happy Knitting!",
