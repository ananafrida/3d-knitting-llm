  "full_text": "This pattern is free to use for personal or selling use! All I ask is that you please link to my pattern in your listing! The Petits Pieds (Little Feet) pattern is an add-on pattern for your favorite longies, overa«lls or romper patterns! This pattern does NOT contain instructions to knit longies. You can add Petits Pieds to your longies before adding the leg cuff, or add them after…your choice!! This is a pattern/tutorial for converting your favorite longies pattern into footies (longies with attached feet/socks)! These Petits Pieds also have a cuff, so they will look like longies with socks underneath, but these socks won’t get kicked off! You can also use this pattern for basic socks for your little one. Size: NB (Up to 1 yr., 1-2 yrs., 2-3 yrs.) Finished length of sock from the back of the heel to the toe: 3” (4”, 5”, 6”) Visit my Ravelry group for updates: http://www.ravelry.com/groups/la-petite-krott",
