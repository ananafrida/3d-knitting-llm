  "full_text": "Something special for December! A deer; a most spiritual creature. And mine is teeny-tiny - to fit in the smallest of pockets, so you can carry it around with you and keep it by your side always. Mine is also posable because I’ve added wires, which I’ve added a how to and what wires to buy within the pattern. The possible bit is purely your choice though - also the size, mine measures a diminutive 7cm/ 2.5in tall - is also something you can change if you wish - just up the yarn weight and needle sizes. Apart from that - this little fellow fallow is quick to knit and uses up your browns and whites stash!",
