  "description": "Koroks are my absolute favorites. I loved them in Wind Waker, and I adore them in Breath of the Wild. They’re cute, make cheerful sounds, and encourage you to be aware of your surroundings—no, not just be aware. To have fun with your surroundings. They embody that joy of exploration, that love of nature, that willingness to be playful no matter how old you are. This pattern is for all of you out there who love Zelda, love koroks, and, most importantly, love to explore.",

  "full_text": "Koroks are my absolute favorites. I loved them in Wind Waker, and I adore them in Breath of the Wild. They’re cute, make cheerful sounds, and encourage you to be aware of your surroundings—no, not just be aware. To have fun with your surroundings. They embody that joy of exploration, that love of nature, that willingness to be playful no matter how old you are. This pattern is for all of you out there who love Zelda, love koroks, and, most importantly, love to explore. The korok is knit from both directions--both from the top and from the bottom, and then both pieces are fused together using kitchener to form a seamless body. Some pieces are then picked up from the body. The pattern does have some small, simple charts to help with picking up limb stitches. Skills used: Knitting in the round, German short rows, kitchener, picking up stitches, simple increases & decreases, embroidery You will need: At least 7 dpns (or at least 2 long circs for magic loop) A tapestry needle and an embroidery needle Felt for the face Embroidery floss Stuffing Scissors Yarn weight doesn’t matter; a thicker yarn will make a larger korok. I suggest mad|tosh unicorn tails—one mini skein nets 2 koroks, and the hand painted nature of the yarn reflects the in-game textures quite well. Please let me know if you run into any issues as you work the pattern. I would love to add some photo instructions to this eventually, but they’re not a priority.",
