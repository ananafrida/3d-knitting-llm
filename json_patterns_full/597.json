  "full_text": "From the pattern description: Of course this blanket can be knit in any color you please, but bright yellow brings an extra spark of joy and light. A pretty textured pattern makes it even livelier. The more you wash this yarn, the softer it gets. 29” circular needle recommended in pattern instructions. Blanket is knit flat. Finished size: 30-1/2 x 34” (77.5x86.5cm)",
