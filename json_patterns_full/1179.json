  "full_text": "A long time ago, I made toddler sized socks, using a partial skein of yellow sock yarn. Unfortunately, I didn’t quite have enough to make a full pair, so I added stripes to the foot in a navy tweed. It was very obvious that these socks were a scrap yarn project. To make them look a bit more intentional, I got out some cotton crochet thread and made a pair of wings, appliqued them to the instep, and then added a face and antennae to the toe to make bee socks. I think they came out really cute, and my toddler at the time really liked wearing them. This pattern is for the wings, just in case you ever need to make socks that look like flying insects. Make them in just about any thread. The first sample pictured was done in embroidery floss. The ones shown attached to a sock were done in #10 crochet cotton. Sizes 5 or 8 thread would also work.",
