  "full_text": "These knit feathers work up quickly and provide a great way to use small amounts of yarn you’re likely to be left with after putting your Advent Calendar to use. Use any color you want. Pair 2-3 scraps. Experiment with stripes. Whatever you do, it’s going to be beautiful. Consider using them individually as keychains, bookmarks, etc. Include them along with tassels on the ends of a scarf or shawl. Or join lots them together for a full project made of feathers. I’d love to see your creations! You’ll follow the same pattern for either DK or sock weight yarn, with DK obviously resulting in a larger feather. Gauge is not important. Below is my needle size recommendation, but choose what feels right to you. Yardage varies, but the maximum you should need for a single feather (if worked as the large version) is 15 yds. The pattern is the same for both yarn weights, but you’re able to choose a small or large version. Both versions begin the same, but where the small feather begins decreasing, you’ll continue another increase section for the large version.",
