  "full_text": "This cute mini pumpkin is just for fun! You see the mini pumpkins in the shops every fall…this way you will always have your own on hand. Makes a great gift! October 5, 2022: Plaid Wee Pumpkin I added a plaid version, which is included in the free pattern. It is fussy, but a fun knit! I recommend going up a needle size for the colorwork. You can also wait until the 16 plain rows to start the colorwork (labelled 1-16 on the chart) -- the first few rows aren’t really visible anyway! The chart follows the regular Wee Pumpkin pattern, without the final decrease. I have been leaving 16 sts at the end -- it works well for adding the stick, which I now hot glue in place. Size One size: 3 ½ inches wide by 2 inches high Materials Heavy fingering weight to sport weight yarn, ~40 yards. Samples shown in these yarns: Cascade 220 Superwash Sport, Color 822 Pumpkin, 136 yds / 50 gms Berroco Ultra Alpaca Light, Color 4201 Winter White, 144 yds / 50 gms Three Irish Girls Glenhaven CashMerino Sock, Color Lucky Penny, 370 yds / 3.5 oz Gauge Gauge is not important!! Yay!! Approx. 26 sts and 36 rows over 4 inches in stockinette in the round Needles Size 2.75 mm dpns or your preferred method for small gauge knitting Notions Polyfill stuffing, small stick (or cinnamon stick), strong sock yarn, string, or twine; long, sharp needle",
