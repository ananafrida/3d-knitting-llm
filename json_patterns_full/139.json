  "description": "Stack up the periodic table with these squishy toy blocks! Each block face features the atomic number and symbol of a different element. The pattern includes instructions for plain blocks and color charts for the elements Hydrogen (1) through Neodymium (60). The color on these blocks was worked in duplicate stitch for texture; however, the pattern can easily be adjusted for stranded color knitting by working each face separately.",
