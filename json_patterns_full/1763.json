Worked in the round similar to a speed swatch, this tiny bit of knitting wizardry provides a satisfying canvas for playing with color combinations. You might just find yourself knitting a small pile of these for friends! It uses a very small amount of yarn: Main Color (lines): about 20 yards / 18 meters Background Color: about 30 yards / 27 meters Pattern can be worked at a variety of gauges, from sport weight to heavy worsted weight; select a pair of circular needles in the size recommended for that weight yarn.
