  "full_text": "The original blanket used 2 skeins (with 7 oz. yarn remaining). More skeins can be used for a larger blanket although this pattern only references to 450 yards. Stockinette stitch best shows the fun “flowers” created with the Hayfield Baby Blossom Chunky yarn. Let the yarn do the work. When changing skeins, be sure to find the matching color sequence to continue the pattern with continuity. The first stitch of every row will be Sl1 WYIB. The cast on must be an odd number to work for the seed stitch pattern. Any odd number will work if you would like to make your blanket larger or smaller.",
