  "full_text": "I’ve been seeing a bunch of patterns for crochet balloon dogs lately and they seem fun, so I wanted to make a knit version. I used 2.5 skeins of super bulky chenille yarn that didn’t have a brand, or even a label. They were about 2.8-3.5 oz (80-100 g) and 44-50 yd (40-45 m) each skein. Any kind of yarn would work with this pattern, but note that a different gauge will affect the final size. Use needles a few sizes smaller than recommended so the stuffing doesn’t show. You will also need about 1.5-3.5 oz (42-100 g) of fiber fill depending on the size. You may make and sell products from my pattern but please credit me and/or link back to my post and use your own photos. Have fun with it!",
