  "full_text": "So, the first user of the FroggyBug Spherical Egg is the Octopus. The spherical egg pattern is available in https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/froggybug-spheri... The Octopus is derived from my stuffed Octopus, but the pattern has been fully revised. This 2-in-1 soft toy doesn’t require any stuffing. The Octopus can hide or sleep into the egg, and folder the egg shell to fit inside the head and belly when active. The whole lot, toy and egg are knit with the same yarn quality. I like knitting with thin needles (2mm / size 0), so I use sock yarn in many different colours. If a thicker yarn is used, both egg and toy will become bigger, in the same proportions. Main techniques are knit / purl in the round garter stitch and short rows i-cord 3 needle bind off (detailed in the pattern) Very basic embroiding for the face magic circle crochet for the eyes Requirement circular needle or set of 4 double pointed needles for the knit-in-the-round part circular needle or long needles for the tentacles an extra needle for the 3 needle bind off a tapestry needle A lot of time and patience! for info, I tried to time some parts: 1 tentacle with safe yarn tails: 60 minutes 1 sucker: 10 minutes, and there are 8x7=56! egg: 6-7 hours… Process - High level description As most of my patterns, the Octopus is built-in, there is no sewing at the end. If you are a beginner in knitting or in a hurry, maybe save this pattern for later, as it is quite long to make. The 8 tentacles are knit flat in garter stitch and short rows, and closed on themselves to get pipes The “pipes” are joined in a circle the obtained stitches are knit and purled in the round, decreasing progressively, to shape the shoulders until 24 stitches are remaining The head is 48 stitches knit in the round, starting from those 24 stitches Stitches from the bottom of the tentacles are picked up and knit/purl in-the-round for just a few rows An octagonal flap is knit on the top of that, attached to the octopus under 6 tentacles, leaving an opening under two tentacles. The suckers are just knots on small I-cord strings, they can be started at any stage of the project The smile is embroidered and the eyes are sewed as symmetrically as possible Following instructions from FroggyBug Spherical Egg, a 125st or 130 st egg is knit and fixed to the inside centre of the flap, with a 10-15 cm (4”-6”) string.",
