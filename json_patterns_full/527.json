  "full_text": "Took a cowl over for a friend. Asked her silver-haired, bike-riding, ultra marathon-running (100k) husband if he’d wear one - he just spluttered. So I asked him to try it on - within less than a minute HE was explaining to me in great technical detail why this was the perfect item for all of his outdoor pursuits. Honestly, much more practical for active guys than a scarf - if only you can get them to try…. For snow clearing : it can be pulled up over the face For wood-cutting : no danger of it getting caught in the chainsaw Some of the guys like a closer-fit, so I added a tighter “guy” size. Sizes ladies might like are included too. Many thanks to the testers (and their male models ☺): spikeysandy knitgrl xstitch PaulineSpinks skyhooked wireknitter unitwo symonangel (with her own Gift of Grace handspun)",
