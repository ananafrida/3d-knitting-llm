  "full_text": "A paid version of this pattern is available with more sizes (3 months to child size 10), improved sizing for the 3 and 6 month sizes and construction updates . NOTE: I’ve been getting some feedback that the pattern is running a bit small. I used some standard baby sizing that I found, but I don’t have a real life baby to try these on! In the future I will reassess the fit, but for this pattern I’ve adjusted the age ranges listed. Please consult the finished measurements listed in the pattern for your particular kiddo. :-) This is an extremely simple and quick knit that makes a very charming sweater for your little guy or gal. Using an aran weight yarn makes the knitting go fast, and the top down design means there is no seaming to drive you crazy! I think the shawl collar adds an air of sophistication - like this baby belongs in a library, sipping tea and reading Shakespeare!
