The pattern uses knit, purl, yarn over, reverse yarn over, knit 2 together, purl 2 and 3 together in a nice combination and sometimes at the same time with smock. The knitting strength is not important. Nice pattern if you'd like to challenge yourself a bit. The pattern uses knit, purl, yo, M1T, k2tog, p2tog, p3tog in a lovely blend and sometimes in a smock. Gauge is not important.",
