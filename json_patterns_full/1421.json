  "full_text": "You can find this pattern for free, supported by advertisements on my blog. -or- you may purchase the advertisement free, printable PDF from Ravelry. Thank you! Note! Be sure that you can find suitable handles before beginning your pattern! This bag is made with the double seed stitch pattern which looks lovely and is quite simple. Its made by simply knitting a large rectangle, folding it in half, seaming the sides and attaching some pretty handles. These handles were found at Jo-Ann Fabric. Tip: Make sure that you purchase the handles before you make the bag in case your store is sold out.",
