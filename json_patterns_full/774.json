  "description": "Sweater is knitted from top down with drop shoulder sleeves. The upper back is worked first, shaped with short rows then worked to the underarms and placed on hold. Stitches for the the left front are picked up along the sloped cast on edge and knitted down to the underarm with the V neck shaping. And the stitches are then placed on hold while the right front is worked. Underarm onwards, all the stitches are worked in one piece. When the body is completed, the sleeves are picked up along the armhole opening, then worked in the round to the cuff. Stitches for the neckband are picked up along the neckline, and worked 1x1 ribbing back and forth.",
