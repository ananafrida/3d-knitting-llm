  "full_text": "And it’s about time! Here is a no-nonsense cowl that will match your Sockhead Hat perfectly. In fact, it’s even easier than the hat. No muss, no fuss…just beautiful yarn and cuddles. Just like its sister-project, this cowl also has miles and miles of Stockinette Stitch. However, that also makes it an ideal project for travelling or TV knitting. This neckwarmer can be worn a few different ways: fold the ribbed ends (inside or out), fold it in half or just pull it on and get out in the snow! This cowl is knit in one piece in the round. This cowl has one size (adjustable) and no visible seam. Skill Level: Rookie- Apprentice-Virtuoso-Genius Skills: knit, purl Finished Measurements: approx 27 cm wide across middle (not across ribbing) and 50 cm long lying flat after blocking Other Materials: tapestry needle or teeny crochet hook; stitch marker Looking for a matching hat? Try the Sockhead Slouch Hat! Or maybe some matching gloves: Pioneer Gloves!",
