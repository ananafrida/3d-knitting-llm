  "full_text": "I was looking for a pattern for a little mouse for Lemmy to play with, and I didn’t want to sew it up the middle, and I wanted it to have an i-cord tail. Since I couldn’t find a pattern like this, I wrote one. Here it is. This is a pattern for a catnip mouse, knit in the round, with an i-cord tail. This pattern is great for knitting up your scrap yarn, and can be knit with worsted weight, too. Great as a special gift for a friend who has a cat--if you go for a visit you won’t arrive empty handed and you’ll make a new feline friend! Materials & Needles: Size 2 dpns and DK weight scrap yarn. This pattern is great for using up those little random balls you have lying around. Special Stitches: LI—Left slanting increase",
