  "full_text": "Getting a baby hat to fit well is a challenge because the size of babies’ heads defies prediction. When my doctor could give me zero guidance on how big my twin’s heads would be, I designed this hat to cover all my bases. This super stretchy hat design fits a wide range of tiny heads from 9 to 15.5 inches / 22 to 40 cm circumference. The average newborn baby’s head is around 13.5 inches / 35 cm. This hat favors babies on the small side of average, which makes it a great pattern for knitting hats for your local hospital or premie charity. The brim rolls up easily, allowing for a variety of depths. It’s also a great hat for new born photos since the cute peaked crown hides the temporary cone-heads and funny skull shapes that frequently afflict the newest members of the human family. Worked in a two-by-two rib with decreases that form lovely arches, this hat is simple, stylish, and truly unisex. About this Pattern Skill Level: Beginner Skills Needed: Basic knitting skills (knit, purl, slip) and basic decreases (ssk, k2tog). Finished Size: Unstretched circumference at brim: 9 inches / 22 cm Depth from peak of crown to brim: 5.5 inches / 14 cm Yarn: Infinite Twist Helix Superwash (two-ply sport weight, 300 y / 100 gm), 75 y / 68 m. Shown in Sunflower. Needles: U.S. size 3 / 3.25 mm dpns, or circular needles to magic loop. Gauge (after blocking): 32 stitches / 46 rows over 4 inches / 10 cm in 2 x 2 ribbing. Notions : At least one stitch marker, yarn needle to weave in ends.",
