  "full_text": "Thank you for choosing to knit The Daisy Chain scarf. A playful project for all seasons. Inspired by the charm of daisy chains and the feeling of a warm breeze, this little scarf is designed to add a sweet touch to any outfit. Knitted from tip to tip, it grows to a soft point in the middle before tapering again, with petal like motifs and tiny bobbles forming a summery pattern that runs along its length. An i-cord edge gives it a clean, modern finish, and the length is adjustable depending on how you’d like to wear it. Try it knotted once at the neck, tucked into a jacket, or worn long and loose on cooler evenings. Made in my Devon 4ply yarn which is a soft blend of Exmoor Blueface and Romney, it’s light and breezy, with just enough texture to show off the detail. A perfect project for holiday knitting, slow afternoons, or whenever your hands need something simple and sweet to work on. Sizes: One size (Instructions for adding repeats) Finished measurements: Sample 1: Length 109 cm/ 43” Width 24.5 cm/ 9.75” Sample 2: Length 150 cm/ 59” Width 41 cm/ 16” Needles: Size 3.5 mm (US 4) circular needles, 80 cm/32” long or needle size to obtain gauge Cable needle if not using the ‘no cable needle’ method Notions: Tapestry needle, cable needle Gauge: 14 sts x 28 rows = 5.7 cm x 9 cm/2.25” x 3.5” in motif Yarn: Annabel Williams Devon 4ply (4ply weight, 100% wool, 400 m/437.5 yds per 100g/3.5oz skein) 1 skein The light green sample in colourway Picnic Blanket was knit without the midsection increases and decreases to make a narrow scarf.
