  "description": "This is a pattern that I had created for the back heel of my Heart Clog Socks. It was fun to do and thought it might be a good pattern to share. It can be used for other projects (graph included on the pattern sheet) or incorporated in projects that you are creating. Although this was created for a particular heel on a sock the graph can be used for other projects. Be creative…and have fun!",
