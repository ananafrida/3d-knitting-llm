  "full_text": "———————— Find kits HERE ———————— HOLD THE LINE is light and airy sweater that combines the delicate texture of laceweight yarn held together with mohair, creating a soft, fluffy fabric with beautiful drape. This flattering raglan design is knit from the top down and features wide, modern stripes that add a playful touch to the classic silhouette. The collar is folded and two sleeve options are provided — choose between a straight sleeve with a loose cuff or a slight balloon sleeve with a snug cuff. SIZES 1 (2, 3, 4) (5, 6, 7, 8) Finished circumference: 43 (46.75, 50.75, 53.75) (56, 59, 61.25, 64.25)” 110 (119, 129, 137) (143, 150, 156, 164) cm Measurements above are given for the finished circumference measured at underarms. This sweater is designed to be worn with approximately 8-10” / 20 - 25.5 cm of positive ease; however, this is just a guide. Some people prefer a closer fit; do not be afraid to select an option that provides somewhat less than the suggested ease according to your preferences. YARN Sonder Yarn Co.

If working the pattern with a single strand of Sport weight yarn, then you will need yardage equivalent to one yarn quality in C1 and C2. Body and sleeves can be lengthened or shortened by working more or less rounds before starting the ribbing. Adding length will affect yardage requirements.",
