  "full_text": "ENG: Pattern Description Eclosion is a relaxed and airy sweater, designed to be your ideal companion during those transitional days between seasons. Its look is both modern and timeless, thanks to its simple construction that showcases a textured yarn. The sweater features: A slightly oversized (loose) fit, offering maximum comfort and a flattering drape. Balloon-style sleeves with a detailed sleeve head and ribbed cuffs, creating a beautiful volume. A seed stitch (or garter stitch, depending on the appearance) on the body for a subtle texture and excellent definition of the speckled yarn. A simple round neckline, finished with ribbing. It’s perfect for showcasing speckled or multi-colored yarns!
