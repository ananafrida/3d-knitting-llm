  "full_text": "Simple, versatile bowls in two sizes. Worsted weight (held with yarn double stranded): approximately 7cm height, 13cm diameter. Uses 130m/65g Super Bulky weight: approximately 8cm height, 16cm diameter. Uses 100m/120g. Ideal for first time knitting in the round or felting. Gauge is not critical for this pattern, as long as you are happy with the fabric created. This may affect the final size of the project along with the yarn amounts required.",
