Their parents love math and chemistry, so I wanted to created a toy that honored that, while being safe for the newborn twins. Thus, my molecular set was born! As a thank you to the Ravelry community, I’m offering this pattern for free! DISCLAIMER: Using this pattern with written gauge, each atom will have a 11.5” circumference. I intentionally made them big to avoid choking hazard. Still, please supervise children under 3 when playing with this set, especially if you use a smaller gauge.",
