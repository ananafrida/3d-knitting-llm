  "full_text": "I’ve only knit this once and it hasn’t been test knit! Be on the look out for errors. I’ve seen some forked short row heels lately, but couldn’t find a pattern so I gave it a shot. This heel creates a “box” for the round part of your heel to sit in creating that extra bit of room that, I feel, short row heels are always lacking. This pattern assumes you are comfortable with heel construction and wraps and turns. It can be knit toe up or cuff down.",
