  "full_text": "Espace Tricot is a yarn store in Montreal, Canada. Discover our yarns here! www.espacetricot.com The Cooler Side of Warm is a cozy cowl knit from the bottom up. It begins with 1x1 ribbing knit flat and then is joined to be worked in the round. As a result, it has a split-hem on one side that allows it to sit comfortably on the shoulder and lie flat against the back and chest. It is finished with 1x1 rib on a smaller needle to prevent gaping at the neck. Woolfolk Far makes this functional beauty exquisitely soft and decidedly sophisticated. Turn down part of the ribbing and attach a Latch Leather Closure from Jul Designs to add a little attitude. :-)",
