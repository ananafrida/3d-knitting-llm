  "description": "I am always in search of creative fidget toys for my son, and love incorporating my craft into these projects. I stumbled upon a post on social media showing a small knit bracelet tube with a marble, and have since been making them for my son and other family and friends. A few knitters requested I write directions for how I make the bracelets, so here they are! These simple bracelets are suitable for children and adults. Directions are included for both fingering and DK weight yarns. Enjoy!",
