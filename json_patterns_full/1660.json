  "full_text": "Newborn Vertebrae is a frontless cardy to keep your little one’s back and arms warm. This free pattern is written for 4ply/fingering weight yarn, and to fit a newborn babe 3-4.5kg (7-10lb) in weight, with an approximate chest circumference of 37.5cm. Construction The pattern has you cast on at the neckline, and work flat, utilising standard raglan increases until you reach the required chest size. From here the arm stitches are put on to waste yarn (or a stitch holder), and the body completed. You then return to the sleeves, working them in the round to length, before picking up stitches framing the body to create a ribbed edging. Skills required knitting small circumferences in the round picking up stitches If you are not familiar with these techniques you may need to reference a knitting guide book, or view videos on the internet. Materials 4ply/fingering weight yarn (350-450m/100g) This pattern is suitable for yarn with good elasticity and memory – a wool or wool blend. Suggested yarn: Malabrigo Yarn Sock (402m/100g) 0.5 skein If you need pattern support, please visit my group Why choose a frontless cardigan? If you have ever been mama to a bub with reflux, or simply a spilly babe, you will understand how frustrating it is to keep washing the dirty fronts of cardigans and sweaters. Newborn Vertebrae is also excellent for baby wearing, and getting in some skin to skin cuddles with your newborn. Baby Vertebrae, Kiddy Vertebrae, and Mama Vertebrae So you’ve enjoyed knitting the Newborn Vertebrae, but your baby is getting too big to squeeze in any longer? Newborn Vertebrae comes in comprehensive patterns: Baby Vertebrae - newborn to 2 years, and 3 yarn weights (fingering, dk, and worsted) Kiddy Vertebrae - 12 months to 10 years, and 5 yarn weights (fingering, dk, light worsted, aran, bulky) Mama Vertebrae - 72.5cm - 102.5cm upper chest circumference, and 4 yarn weights (fingering, dk, worsted, aran)",
