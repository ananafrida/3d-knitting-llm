  "full_text": "This is a cat toy stuffed with a cork from a wine bottle instead of polyfill or yarn scraps. A cork gives the toy a good weight for thumping and skittering but won’t leave floof everywhere when kitty tears it to shreds. A little catnip inside the fish or letting the fish marinate in the catnip bag probably wouldn’t hurt. Korkfisshe can be knit to sell for charity or for the personal use of a cat you like a lot. The name Korkfisshe is a play on Korknisse , which are very cute.",
