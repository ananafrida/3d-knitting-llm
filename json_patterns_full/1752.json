  "full_text": "This is a simple fake wasp nest that can be displayed as decoration. The ridges are created through a combination of knits and purls. It is knitted flat in a triangular shape, and seamed at the back. Please note that the project is not seamless, and the join at the back will be visible. The pattern doesn’t suffer too much from using a variety of yarn weights at the same time, which makes for a great stashbusting project! For convenience, the pattern has the number of stitches left in the needle at the end of each row. And if you need video instructions for any of the required skills, there are some links for you to peruse before tackling the project.",
