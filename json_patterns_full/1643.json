  "description": "Let’s knit a bushel of fall fruits! This fun, free pattern offers two gourd-geous shape variations. Knit the apple with horizontal stitches, or try the vertical pumpkin pattern, perfect for showcasing self-striping yarn that’ll have your project looking like the pick of the patch. Once the knitting is complete, stick a small branch or cinnamon stick into the center for a fabulous finish. Worked in Luv &amp; Lee by Zitron, there should be enough yarn in each 50g ball to make two pieces. Embrace the fall vibes and add a touch of coziness to your home with a collection of these high-fiber fruits.",
