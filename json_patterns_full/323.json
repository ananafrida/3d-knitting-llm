  "full_text": "This mouse has been tested and pronounced “catproof” ie, it shouldn’t come to pieces with even the most ferocious catnip addict! I make the little catnip sachets by spreading the catnip over one half of a piece (say 30x60cm approx) of loosely woven material and then machine sewing it into little squares approx 3x3cm with criss cross tramlines. Then I cut between these tramlines. It’s quick and not too messy. I can make this mouse in 20 minutes if I have absolutely no interruptions (which is usually impossible to do of course), hence the title of the pattern.",
