It is worked starting from the left sleeve, then mitred corners, decreases and increases make the raglan shapings and back section. The right sleeve completes the main shape. Stitches picked up along the front edges and back base are used to finish the garment, including the buttonholes.",

Stitches picked up along the front edges and back base are used to finish the garment, including the buttonholes. The BMJ initials of the pattern title reflect and admire the Elizabeth Zimmerman BSJ - Baby Surprise Jacket - which is also knitted as an unusual shape in garter stitich. Also like the BSJ, this BMJ pattern includes other sizes which are easy adaptations of the original pattern.",
