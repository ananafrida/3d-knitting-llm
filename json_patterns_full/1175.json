I designed these wings for the pattern Nilla the Unicorn by Rachel Borello Carroll, but you could use these wings for another pattern that has similar proportions. I recommend using the same yarn/needle weight as the rest of your project. I made my wings using my CC for the Nilla the Unicorn pattern.",
