  "full_text": "UPDATE 2021 This free pattern has been updated based on several edits and questions that have come in over the past 2 years. I hope these edits make it easier to read, especially for newbie knitters. I have added a separate “ Character Pattern ” PDF to my Ravelry shop. The separate PDF will teach you how to make your B.Y. reach maximum cuteness. For example, how to set the eyes back, knit B.Y. in the round, and much more. It has 4 video tutorials plus lots of clearly written instructions. You can find the separate pattern here or in my Ravelry shop. Thanks to everyone who has reached out with questions, photos, and notes. I absolutely love seeing your finished products and can’t wait to see more! Keep them coming! Please do not sell or recreate this pattern. It’s intended to be free. This pattern has not been tested by anyone but me. Please reach out anytime with edits and I’ll make them. Thanks y’all! Remember it’s a free pattern, have fun and be kind! This pattern requires some extra notions including 2 smooth black buttons (5/8”), tapestry needle, ivory sewing thread, and a sewing needle. The final doll measures approximately 7” tall and 5” wide at the mid-body.",
