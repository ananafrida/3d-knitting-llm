  "full_text": "From Knitty: I created this heart for Valentine’s Day. I wanted something lovey-dovey to celebrate the day, hold the saccharin! If you too wish to give away your heart to someone, or put it on the shelf, or wear it on your sleeve, this pattern may be the answer. It is a fairly simple construction, knit all in one piece, and is a quick knit project despite the small gauge. Note: Pattern calls for one skein each of two colors but states this will give you enough yarn for three hearts plus leftovers. The yardage entered above is an estimate of how much yarn is needed for a single heart.",
