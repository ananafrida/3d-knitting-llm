  "full_text": "The Microwaves Tee is designed to have a boxy, oversized and slightly cropped fitting with approx ~15cm of positive ease around bust. It is worked top down in the round, using stockinette stitches. You’ll first start casting on the bottom of the neck, then work your raglan increases until reaching the under arms, where body and armholes are split. Then, you’ll continue working the body in the round while working on some decreases for a better fitting. Sleeves are worked in the round from the stitches on hold of your raglan increases. Neck is also worked in the round by picking up stitches on your initial cast on border. The name of the pattern is inspired by the music “microwaves” by In Explosions.
