The first example I knitted up, creating this purse pattern, I used my own handspun yarn with fibers from gray Swedish sheep with spots of dyed blue and violet wool fibers (from Höner och Eir). Small spots of the blue popped up in the lace section of the purse, and reminded me of the beauty of harvest hay from a diverse meadow. Also I think that the simple, yet decorative lace pattern remind me of the flower.",

  "full_text": "Kråkvicker ( Vicia cracca ) is a the blue and violett spots that can glow in a dry hay harvest. In other words: it is a flower. The first example I knitted up, creating this purse pattern, I used my own handspun yarn with fibers from gray Swedish sheep with spots of dyed blue and violet wool fibers (from Höner och Eir). Small spots of the blue popped up in the lace section of the purse, and reminded me of the beauty of harvest hay from a diverse meadow. Also I think that the simple, yet decorative lace pattern remind me of the flower. Kråkvicker is a small handbag or purse, which I created to get a purse mainly for my cellphone when I’m around home and in the forest and do not have pockets or a bag. It turned out I use it all the time. If you have knitted socks from toe up and knitted icord - this will be a walk in the park! If you haven’t - I think it will be an easy knit anyway. I have tried to include videos on the cast on method as well as the bind off (icord bind off). The lace pattern is ridiculously easy. The bag is knitted in the round with circular needles or three DPNs (double pointed needles). The icord is easiest to do with DPNs. I think this pattern is perfect for that small skein of handspun, or in other way special, yarn that you don’t know that to do with. I don’t know how much yarn that you need, but it is not much. You can use any yarn and gauge that you want, but don’t choose a too bulky yarn - and try the lace pattern so that it shows off great with the yarn and needle you go for. In the samples I have a gauge that is about 20-22 stitches for 10 cm (stockinette), using needle size 3.25 mm. The measurement of the bag is about 14 X 14 cm. Use a little bit smaller needles that your would have for another project with your selected yarn, to make the bag durable and strong! Please note that the pattern is free, and not test knitted by others than me. It might be errors in the pattern. Please contact me if you have questions or comments, and I’ll try to answer subject to time. I would be happy if you try to knit the Kråkvicker bag!",
