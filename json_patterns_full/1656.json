  "full_text": "24 mini mittens to use as an advent calendar or tree decorations. Please Note: All 24 pdfs for these mittens are still available as free separate downloads from my site. You can find links to each of them here . Many people have asked me to put them together as one pdf that they can purchase and have in their Ravelry library, so that is what this is. Please do not post project pictures with all or most of the charts in them, thanks! This paid download contains 1 written pattern, 24 mitten charts and a blank chart to design your own mitten. It also has had the pattern tech edited and charts updated since the original free KAL. Each mitten is about 4.5” tall and 2.25” wide (not including thumb), just big enough for a small gift. Approximate amount of yarn needed is: Red (Pimento) - 77 grams - 359 yards White - 67 grams - 312 yards Light Grey (Finnley Heather) - 76 grams - 355 yards Dark Grey (Ash) - 6 grams - 28 yards Total - 226 grams - 1054 yards",
