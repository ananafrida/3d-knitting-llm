Knitting-wise He’s knitted and shaped with short rows and pick up stitches - as are all of my patterns. I’ve listed the yarn I knitted him in within the pattern but you can adapt yarn choices to suit yourself - there is also a KIT available HERE And if you’d like to knit his sweet-piglety companion then that pattern is here - ( Also don’t forget Pooh - he’s here And Roo - who’s free here And of course Eeyore who’s here there’s also a kit for him too and last but not least (for now) - Tigger! I hope you love your Wol as much as I love mine… and follow along with my Instagram @doptpebbles_knits for the last up and coming other character to complete this series !",
