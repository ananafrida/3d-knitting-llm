  "full_text": "Adorable Poppy the hen is ready to sit pretty in your house or be cuddled by your favorite little one! Add a touch of farm whimsy to any space and make her in any colors you like. This super easy pattern works up quickly and is simple enough for new knitters. Photos are also included to help you along. Pick your favorite yarn shade and go! If you’re careful with your yarn usage, you can get two chickens out of one skein of Lion Brand Wool Ease Thick & Quick (plus the yarn for the crest and beak). Materials: 1 skein Lion Brand Yarn Wool Ease Thick & Quick super bulky yarn in Oatmeal or preferred color for the body 170 g/skein & 106 yds/skein Pattern uses 85 g 1 skein Lion Brand Yarn Hometown USA super bulky #6 yarn in Tampa Spice (red) 1 skein Lion Brand Yarn Hometown USA super bulky #6 yarn in Madison Mustard (yellow) US Size 15 10.0mm, 16” inch circular knitting needles Small black safety eyes or black yarn for eyes (if being used by children) Fiber fill for stuffing (5-10 oz) Scissors Tapestry needle to seam and weave in ends Measuring Tape Finished Size (approximate): 6.5” wide x 8.5” long x 8” tall at crest Gauge: Not important for this pattern Pattern Notes: You will begin by knitting a flat square base for your chicken in garter stitch. Next, you’ll pick up stitches evenly around the base to knit the chicken in the round. You’ll simply knit until the specified height. The stuffing, beak, eyes and wings are then added. The chicken is closed up on the top with a simple whip stitch seam. There is no shaping in the pattern except for the wings (which are optional!). While this chicken has safety eyes, you may also use black yarn to create eyes. If Poppy will be around little ones or small children, black yarn secured tightly should be used for safety reasons. See the photos for additional assistance. Have fun! Abbreviations (US) & Skills: The chicken body section is knit in the round. You should know how to pick up stitches.
