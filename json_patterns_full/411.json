  "full_text": "Simple modular poncho design with an applied i-cord border. No need to pick up stitches all the way around, yay! You will be holding two strands of different colours for a marled effect. The poncho is knitted in sections that are attached as you go. Easy and fun project, incorporating lots of different colours of fingering weight, so go dive into that stash! Approximate yardage requirements for the squares: Smaller square: 36g of Sock Yarn held double, 72m of each colour. Bigger rectangle: 72g of Sock Yarn held double, 144m of each colour. Please note - the yarn is held double, so while you need around 850g of yarn, you will be knitting only around 1700m. So i you decide to go for a DK weight instead of fingering doubled you will need about 1700m.",
