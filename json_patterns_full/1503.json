  "full_text": "Enjoy not 1 but 2 patterns as free downloads through November 23rd. The “Faux Fur Cloche & Cowl” set is easy to knit. I knitted mine from a kit, which includes mini skeins of the faux fur, so convenient! Happy knitting and please add the patterns to your faves, I would appreciate it~ Throughout the rest of the year save 25% automatically on all my over 590 patterns and 65 ebooks, just add to cart to see the price drop~ Both patterns are fully written. The cowl is a one size fits all and the cloche for medium and large sizes. A slip stitch pattern is created with two strands of DK weight held together to add more textures and the faux fur yarn is used in the cowl for both edges, in the cloche just for the brim. In case you are wondering about the top I am wearing in the photos, it’s one of my Idris sweaters, and yes, I knitted two of them, one in a blush and one in a mauve color. Yarn Yarn 1: A faux fur yarn in an extra bulky weight. Hat=10 yards, cowl 15 yards. Yarn 2: 2 Easy care DK yarn cakes, enough for both, the cowl and the cloche in both sizes. 272 yards/100 grams each in a super soft washable Acrylic yarn, held with 2 strands together throughout both projects. Notions needed US size 9 (5.5 mm) circular needle 16” (42 cm) in length. Optional double pointed needles US size 9 for the hat. Stitch marker to mark beginnings of rounds. Tapestry needle for finishing. Gauge 14 sts and 21 rows in 4” of stockinette stitch with 2 strands held together. I like the textures of the two yarns together. Techniques applied Knitting in the round, changing yarn, slipping stitches, decreasing, cinching stitches for the hat together with tapestry needle, binding off cowl only, weaving in ends. Blocking is optional. My projects shown were not blocked. Enjoy the knit and do post photos on your project pages, we all love seeing pretty knits. Oh and I would like to invite you to our Holiday knit along HERE .",
