  "full_text": "Construction Flower Girls are knit in one piece from the bottom-up. The doll’s body can be knit flat on straight needles and seamed, or knit in the round on dpns. After knitting, the skirt is worked from stitches picked up around the doll’s waist and embellished with hand embroidery stitches. Simple sewing techniques are used to define the arms and legs after knitting. Gauge Exact gauge is not important. I recommend choosing a needle 2 or 3 sizes smaller than recommended on the ball band to create a dense fabric that will keep the stuffing hidden.",
