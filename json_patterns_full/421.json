  "full_text": "Fly Girl is an updated flight jacket, knit from the bottom up in 3 pieces (2 fronts, 1 back), sewn together. Short row sleeves are knit right on and easy directions are included. Pockets are sewn onto the front and have contrasting flaps. Fold over collar updates the look. A separating zipper creates a true flight jacket and embroidered (running stitch) “FLY GIRL” can be altered to Cheer Girl, Florida Girl, Barista Girl, etc. Comes in sizes S, M, L, XL; 32-34 (36-38, 40-42, 44-46) Worsted yarn in 2 colors completes the look. (I used a 3rd yarn, acrylic, for the words on the back.) Directions are given for easy assembly and adding zipper, by hand, to the front. This is not a design that has long areas of knitting. The numerous details are easy to manage and offer variety throughout, making it a fun knit. It is a fairly quick sweater to knit. If you can do basic sewing, you can make this sweater. I now design for donations to prevent suicide and for the Salvation Army. Please show your appreciation if able, by donating. Thank you!",
