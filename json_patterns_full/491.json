  "description": "Many moons ago, while on a weekend trip with my yarn husband, I decided that I needed a new cowl. As every yarn obsessed knitter does, I popped into the local yarn shop and picked out a gorgeous skein of worsted weight yarn. They wound it and I immediately cast on something simple. By the end of the weekend I had a lovely new souvenir. A few years later I opened my own LYS and re-knit the cowl in a beautiful skein of Malabrigo Rios. I typed up the simple pattern and gave it to customers to enjoy. In a computer fiasco the pattern was lost . Knitters, however, are not that easily defeated and so I reached for a skein of my own daughter’s gorgeous hand-dyed wool and recreated it, this time playing with different needle sizes and cast on amounts until I felt it was just right. The pattern is simple and I’m sure others have surely knitted it before without a pattern as I did in my early years of knitting, But worth recording none-the-less. I hope you enjoy it as I have!",
