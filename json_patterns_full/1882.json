  "description": "Raku is a process that potters use where they place red-hot clay bowls in a bucket of dry leaves. The process creates beautiful one-of-a-kind results. They never know what the end result will look like. Felting your knitted items that are knit in multicolored yarns is much the same as you never know what you’re going to get, but it is all beautiful.",

They never know what the end result will look like. Felting your knitted items that are knit in multicolored yarns is much the same as you never know what you’re going to get, but it is all beautiful. Let the yarn do the talking in these simple-to-knit rolled-edge felted bowls. Plus, after knitting and before felting, add interesting “bobbles” by using river rock or marbles tied into the fabric with rubber bands if you want a truly freeform look! Bowls are knit in the round from the top down.",
