  "description": "A Beanie Baby sized sleeping bag worked in a double knitting technique (one that creates an open center, not joined sides as in reversible colored double knit technique). There are no seams to sew on the bag or the attached pillow! While being worked back and forth on straight needles (or circular needles used as straight if you prefer), a pouch is automatically formed by the double knitting.",

There are no seams to sew on the bag or the attached pillow! While being worked back and forth on straight needles (or circular needles used as straight if you prefer), a pouch is automatically formed by the double knitting. Pattern can be made for larger stuffed animals and dolls by simply increasing the amount of stitches cast on (doubled makes a good 18” doll size), and working more rows for the body and pillow. A good technique to learn for making any type of small flat bags! Have fun adapting, and please let me know variations you come up!",
