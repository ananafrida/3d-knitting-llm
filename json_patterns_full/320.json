Since the dawn of time, rodents and their feline foe have pitted their wits against one another.

Captain Cat-Battler was designed specially for Battersea Dogs & Cats Home and their Cat Knit project . If you use this pattern, please donate to the Home, send a mouse to befriend lonely cats waiting for new owners, or even better, adopt a cat to go with your mouse. Available here too .",
