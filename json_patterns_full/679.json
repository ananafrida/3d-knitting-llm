  "full_text": "The Trasno hat pattern is completely in Spanish, with step-by-step instructions and tutorial videos where I explain the most difficult parts. With a ball of the Drops design Lima quality I knitted the body of the hat, I had to start another ball to be able to make the i-cord. It is a very quick hat to knit. You can find the pattern completely free on my website, if you need help, contact me",
