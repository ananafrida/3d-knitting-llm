  "full_text": "The sharona scarf is a simple stockinette scarf knit from tip to tip with increases along one side and then decreases along the same side. You can make the scarf in any size by using half of your yarn for increases and half for decreases. I made the scarf with yarn purchased from a natural dyer and was a one off colorway which I believe cannot be found anymore. I used 50 grams for the increase side and 50 grams for the decrease side. I used two different colors to make a two-toned scarf but you can use one color, two, or many! Since it’s stockinette when you block the scarf I recommend pinning it flat and blocking quite aggressively.",
