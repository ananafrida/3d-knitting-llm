The glossy rayon ribbon yarn, silk lining, and beaded flower appliqué dress up an otherwise simple design. The purse is worked in easy stockinette and features clear plastic handles and a magnetic snap closure. The pattern is easy enough for a new knitter and is sized right to carry the essentials.",
