We received 2,404 exactly! You can see lots of photos from this project over on Instagram . If you missed taking part but would still like to support this project, you can donate funds directly to the American Foundation for Children with AIDS .** Mochimochi Land is going to Vogue Knitting LIVE in NYC this January, and we want to make a splash with a whole ball pit full of knitted mochimochi balls! After Vogue Knitting LIVE, the balls will be donated to the American Foundation for Children with AIDS , who will send them to kids in Congo, Uganda, Kenya, and Zimbabwe. Thank you to our sponsor, Cheers To Ewe! To make this squishy cuddly fun possible, we need YOUR help: Please join us in knitting hundreds of colorful character balls! The deadline for contributions is January 3, 2019. The free pattern (available in both flat and circular versions) knits up quickly with less than 10 yards of yarn needed. It’s a great project for yarn scraps! ** Please help us spread the word! You can download a printable flyer along with the pattern from this page. ** Crocheted balls are welcome too! Here’s a free pattern by Naomi Grattan . We can’t wait to receive all your squishy happy mochimochi balls!",
