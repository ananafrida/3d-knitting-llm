  "description": "A very quick to knit and simple pattern to keep your skates looking fresh. Use whatever yarn you have but be mindful it’s not going to be the most robust protection, I do think that worked in garter they might be a little more hard wearing. To make them more robust you could work them in garter or with a denser fabric (i.e 3 strands of fingering weight yarn) Don’t forget this is a guide, feel free to add texture, be playful and add some colour to your skating. I think they would also look cute with a central cable.",
