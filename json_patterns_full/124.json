  "full_text": "This is a tutorial for making a simple garter stitch cube and balls in matching colours. This is a brilliant stash-busting project or a project for a beginner knitter. It is very quick to knit and make up too, so it would be a good last-minute gift for a baby or toddler. The cube and balls can be used in a variety of ways. Teach your children their colours and get them to match the balls to the faces of the cube. Add some felt dots to turn the cube into a die and knit a corresponding number of balls for each face. The possibilities are limitless. The cube is stuffed with a car washing sponge cut to shape and the balls are filled with toy stuffing.",
