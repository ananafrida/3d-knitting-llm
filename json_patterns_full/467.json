  "full_text": "First published in Knit Today in 2011, I have updated the pattern into my current format. My free Knitted Christmas Trees Pattern is a quick and easy make that uses up small scraps of yarn from your stash. Each little tree is knitted in garter stitch with yarn held double, then finished with a neat knitted trunk. Double knitting yarn (light worsted weight) is held together to create a firm thickness, similar to a light bulky (chunky) yarn. Us 7 (4.5mm) straight knitting needles are used to work flat, in rows, starting from the bottom of the tree, and working up. Alternatively - you can make smaller individual trees for gift-wrapping, using yarn single and 3.25mm needles. Simple decreasing shapes the tree (k2tog). The trunk can either be knitted on, by picking up stitches, or knitted separately and sewn on. Both options are included.",
