For anyone looking for a last-minute hand-made Valentine’s Day gift idea, done and done! These little hearts make a perfect topper for a box of chocolates, or a little handful of them will make your sweetie smile. You’ll need about 6 yards of yarn per heart, and a foot or two of black yarn for eyes. Choose needles (straight, circular, or double-pointed) that are 2-3 sizes smaller than the standard recommendation for the yarn you’re using, to get a tight gauge. You’ll need a pinch of stuffing or scrap yarn for plump, squeezable hearts.",
