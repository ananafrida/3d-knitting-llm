Always use needle size necessary to obtain gauge. US #10/6.00 mm 24-32 in/60-80 cm circular needle US#6/4.00 mm 24-32 in/60-80 cm circular needle US #4/3.55 mm 24-32 in/60-80 cm circular needle US #11/8.00mm 24-32 in/60-80 cm circular needle (optional – to maintain gauge over color charts) Circular needles are recommended because the project is quite heavy and circular needles will support this weight more effectively.
