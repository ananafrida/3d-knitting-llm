  "description": "Today I’d like to show you a block that I’ve worked on for two years, and used in several afghan exchanges. This block was originally featured in one of the Antique CounterPane guides; however, since I didn’t completely ‘create’ it, I offer it for free. I see similar blocks featured in the latest issues of Mary Maxim’s catalogue. There is also one done in Jan Eaton’s 200 Knit Blocks, that has you make a single leaf, and join the four leaves in the corners, to make the four-leaf. That’s just too much work for me!",
