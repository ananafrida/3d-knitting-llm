PATTERN INFORMATION This cardigan is worked starting with the shoulder plackets, which are worked back and forth in stranded colorwork. Stitches are picked up along both plackets, casting on stitches as you go to form the back neck. Short rows are worked to shape the back, before working in Stocking stitch to the underarm. Stitches are picked up along each placket to work the fronts separately to the underarm, then the back and fronts are joined to work back and forth in stranded colorwork. A simple ribbing is worked for the waistband with a tubular cast-off. The stitches for the sleeves are picked up around the armhole and are worked in the round from the top down, with decreases. The cuffs are worked in a simple ribbing with a tubular cast-off in a contrasting colour. Finally the front band/collar is worked in simple ribbing, shaped with short rows and finished with a tubular cast-off.
