  "full_text": "Currently this pattern is just for the door. I am updating it in the fall (2025) to include the windows and chimney! My Hobbit Hole Fairy Doors are my attempt to bring The Shire to my suburban backyard. When I knit them I am instantly transported there and it makes my heart leap for joy. Plus they are a one evening knit! Shire here we come! Construction The door is knit entirely in the round on dpns beginning at the center back and ending with pretty decreases at the center front. The brass door knob is made with a French Knot. Because there is a front and a back there is no need to block!",
