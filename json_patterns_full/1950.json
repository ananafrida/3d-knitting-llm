  "full_text": "This knitted leaf is shaped as a Cape Sweet Pea leaf ( Dipogon lignosis ), native to South Africa. I’m using a “double domino decrease” in this pattern. Traditional domino knitting is knit every row with a double decrease in the center of every other row. This pattern has a double decrease in every row. The leaves look the same on both sides. The two solid-green 37-stitch leaves are 1.75 inches wide and 2.5 inches long without stem at gauge. The 47-stitch variegated leaf is 2.25 inches wide and 3 inches long without stem at gauge. Large leaf in worsted weight Lion brand 24/7 yarn is 4 inches wide and 5 inches long without stem at a bigger gauge. Small leaves are DMC pearl cotton color #989. Medium leaf is DMC pearl cotton #4047. Large leaf is Lion brand 24/7 color “Lime”. Skills needed: cast on, knit, k3tog, kf&b and bind off in knit stitch. Optional: I-cord stem Gauge is not important in this pattern. Any block-able yarn/thread will work. Make a swatch to check gauge and appearance. 7 yards of #5 pearl cotton will make one 37-stitch-cast-on leaf at gauge. 10 yards of #5 pearl cotton will make one 47-stitch-cast-on leaf at gauge One 27-yard skein of DMC #5 pearl cotton will make 3 of the smaller or 2 of the bigger leaves.",
