  "full_text": "I am so sorry! I accidentally uploaded the wrong PDF. I really apologize for the inconvenience. I am uploading the correct one now. These flowers are very easy to make and have so many design possibilities. Worsted weight yarn I used a #5 needle. Sock Yarn I used a #0 needle. You can easily make flowers anywhere from 2.5” to 8” across. Sizes are small, medium and large. These would be a great use for oddments of yarn. Approximate amounts needed are shown in the pattern for both worsted weight and sock yarn for all sizes. If you don’t want to use beads for the middle, you could try french knits or tiny domed buttons. Written pattern is 6 pages has pictures and explanations to help in putting your flower together.",
