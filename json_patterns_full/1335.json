A Latvian Braid makes an easy and impressive looking sash (how to video included). Praise for Decorative Witch Hat Such a fun, little pattern! Made in a minute. And I’ve learned a new technique: the Latvian Braid. (Adente) This little hat can be made in a hour. For the Latvian braid there is good link of how to do it. So no reason to give it a try. (Saphiera) Adorable little witch hat! So easy and quick. I liked the link to the Latvian Braid video-good refresher for the technique. Now to do one more… (thrsedge) Cute little hat and a well written, easy to follow pattern! (MinniStitcher) Knitting the Decorative Witch Hat was so easy, particularly since I already was familiar with knitting in the round. I had never done Latvian Braid stitch before, but the instructions made is really clear, and the results looked great. ( fjorlief)",
