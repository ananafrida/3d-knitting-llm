  "full_text": "This pattern was inspired by Judy’s 12-Section Yarnball. I’ve copied the instructions for stuffing and bind-off from Judy Gibson, San Diego NHM jgibson@cts.com with her permission. She also test knit this pattern. Judy said “I never did succeed in making it swirl, exactly.” So I took up her challenge and this is the result. This ball has six S shaped sections that swirl around. This ball comes out 4” to 4½” in diameter, about the size of a grapefruit. 4-ply knitting yarn, one or two colors (or more) I used two shades of Rose. Knitting needles size US 4 Polyester fiber filling or other stuffing Optional noise element: Plastic Easter egg or film canister with jingle bell or pebbles inside. Glue egg halves together with model glue. Was previously available in Italian at:: https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B3aoGFBsEQEISFhyU2t2Y3hNUDA",
