  "full_text": "Knit Hello is a typeface (or font) made especially for hand knitting. It was developed for beginners – knitters without previous knowledge in typography, and graphic designers who have just picked up their needles. Knit Hello started as workshop exercise showing the basics of Typographic Knitting. Based on Slipstitches, the typeface allows colorwork knitting without long floats and getting entangled. Whether you work on screen or on paper, Knit Hello helps you write ready-to-knit messages and make your own Typographic Knitting pattern! This test pattern shows you the basic knitting techniques to use the typeface.",
