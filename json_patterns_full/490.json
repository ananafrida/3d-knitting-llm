  "description": "These little pots fit in the palm of your hand but are sturdy enough to stand up on their own. You will only need about 15g of double knitting weight yarn to knit a Dotty Pot and a much smaller amount of variegated yarn for the dots. They are knitted in the round and are fun to knit - much easier than they look. Instructions are also included for a bigger pot.",
