  "full_text": "Colorful instead of brown With this template you can knit a patch with the saying “Colorful instead of brown”. You can then sew the patches onto your hat, clothing, backpack or bag. The template is also suitable for embroidering the saying in stitches on knitted items or for cross-stitching textiles. You can also put it in your own project, e.g. B. sweater, and use the chart as a knitting pattern. What else you can do: Go to demos and demonstrate against the right! Get involved in our democracy, even on a small scale. Show a clear stance against fascism. Size of the patches: depending on the yarn thickness, mine is 12 x 17 cm Stitch sample: not important Yarn: any yarn is suitable, you need at least 2 colors of the same yarn thickness with good contrast Usage: my patch weighs 20 grams Needles and accessories: knitting needles that match your yarn thickness. I knitted with 4-ply sock yarn (used twice), leftovers in DK, and a 3.5 mm needle, sewing needle, scissors",
