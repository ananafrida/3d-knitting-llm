  "full_text": "These bright and festive mushroom ornaments are fun to give as small gifts, and decorate a tree or wreath. It’s a great way to use of yarn leftovers. I knit using circular needles in magic loop method. Gauge is not important. If you use other weights or knit loosely, size your needles to achieve a relatively tight knit so the polyfill doesn’t show through. The size is approximately 2.5 inches tall.",
