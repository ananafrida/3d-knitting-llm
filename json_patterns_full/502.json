The level of difficulty will be based on the stitch patterns selected. Notes from the Designer: Chandi challenged me to interpret the phrase, “choose your own destination,” into a knit or crochet pattern. That was the first choice: knit or crochet? And I chose both so that everyone could join in the fun! (If you’d like to choose an adventure in crochet, check out the Appetency pattern.) I’ve provided fourteen stitch patterns that each represent a possible aspect of an adventure. As you answer the following questions, your choices will take you on your journey to create a design that is uniquely yours. Let’s get started! Click here to watch a video in which I show you how to work the Gazing Stitch (Pattern 12). I also provide information about our Summer 2025 Choose Your Own Destination Knit Along.
