  "full_text": "I wanted a mitered block pattern but most of the ones I was finding started with a large number of stitches for the cast on, then decrease to a point. I wanted to work in the reverse direction to make it really simple to get the proper size. While this is probably not an original idea, I have searched for this pattern and could not find it anywhere. This can be worked in any yarn, just choose appropriate needles.",
