  "full_text": "Simple top down stockinette cardigan that lets you get creative with your yarns! Find an awesome combination of colours that makes you happy! The ombré effect is achieved by holding one strand of fingering weight yarn with one strand of fuzzy mohair (Hedgehog Fibres Alpaca Boucle would be great too!) in three different colours and striping the mohair between the colour transitions, while the fingering weight yarn remains the same.",
