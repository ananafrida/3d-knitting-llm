  "full_text": "Babbity is one of my most popular - and most knitted - designs. It is part garter stitch, and part stocking stitch. Many knitters make it all in garter stitch - so I thought I would add a version all in garter stitch - and with a fully buttoned front and a little collar. Requires: DK yarn (25g - 65g Dk, depending on size chosen) 4mm needles small buttons Sizes: small preemie, medium preemie, large preemie, newborn and bigger sizes are on the way ! A great gender-neutral design. So cute To get this free pattern please click on the https link just below ↓",
