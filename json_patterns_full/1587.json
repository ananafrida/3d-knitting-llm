The pictured orange pumpkins were made with chunky yarn, and the white one was made with worsted with no adjustments in the pattern made for the different gauges.",

  "full_text": "These cute pumpkins can be made in bulky/chunky/worsted or any gauge really, as long as the stitches are tight so as to avoid seeing any poly fill sticking out. The pictured orange pumpkins were made with chunky yarn, and the white one was made with worsted with no adjustments in the pattern made for the different gauges. The pattern includes instructions for making small, medium, and large pumpkins, and tips for shaping the pumpkins. I was able to make one pumpkin of each size using two balls of Drops Peak, but it was very close so if you choose a similar yardage and weight, I would purchase an extra ball to be safe. You can also add beans to the bottom of the pumpkins to make them a bit heavier if desired.",
