  "full_text": "Christmas feeling came to me unbelievably early this year. I am playing with various yarns to make small Christmas trees to hang on the actual Christmas tree, put under nice hot mug of tee or hot wine, or send as season greeting to someone dear. Knitted Christmas tree is versatile. It is a simple knit. I think it is suitable for beginners as well, as it involves only knit, purl, knit two together stitches and you have to know how to cast-on. I have put photo tutorial on my blog: http://ferbyscorner.blogspot.com/2011/10/christmas-is-com... Thanks to Miliezebomb there is French version of the pattern available at her blog: http://miliezebomb.canalblog.com/archives/2011/11/30/inde... Decorate knitted Christmas tree as you like or even better, ask your kids to do that! It is a fun activity and kids will keep on asking for more Christmas trees to decorate. Especially preschoolers :)",
