With a cast of well known actors, beautiful locations and costuming, and an interesting story, I am a bit embarrassed to say that what I remember most is that “Oh Balls!” was the stand-out line of the movie for me. A sphere is such a versatile shape to have in one’s knitting repertoire. I use this ball pattern to make fruits, toys or something soft enough to throw at the television (oh like you haven’t wanted to throw something at the tv before).",
