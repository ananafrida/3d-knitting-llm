  "full_text": "Here’s a design I came up with, combining (what I consider to be) the best aspects of all of the acorn patterns I’ve found (and adding my own flavor, too). I’m happy to offer the pattern for free. I like to knit them from small amounts of handspun and/or luxury yarns, and I like to stuff them with waste fiber from the combing process. :) You can use any yarn, but it’s good to have two colors of the same weight yarn. The size of the acorn will be determined by the thickness of the yarn and size of your needles. Enjoy! And please post your projects so I can see them. :)",
