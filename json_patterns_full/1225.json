  "full_text": "Mythology or reality? The reality is that Tarragon is a dragon with a tender heart and an obscure predilection for French cuisine. He will only blow fire for bbq-ing some sausages - to eat with lots of onions and garlic sauce! one day to knit, one second to love! (but beware of his breath!!) Tarragon is stiched on the round using double-pointed needles from bottom to head and is about 24 cm high. One skein main colour (50 gr) is largely sufficient to knit Tarragon. Plus you will need about a quarter of a skein to knit wings and spines. Enjoy! Thank you to Dragonbasket for the German version!",
