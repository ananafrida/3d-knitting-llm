  "full_text": "I just discovered that I friggin love fruit loops. I grew up in an ingredients house and we were only allowed healthy cereal, the best I could ever do was Kix, not even the berry kind. So I wanted to honor that. Of course. Thank you walmart for making them $2.88, they are also excellent as a stand in for rice krispies in the treat of that name. This is a very basic cable and lace-y pattern with both chart and written stitch instructions. Still in testing but I am working on it. PS there is a llama on the box, so it’s best if you knit this with alpaca (jk do whatever you want)",
