  "full_text": "This is the cutest little knitting pattern. One that I developed to meet a need for work, but I’ve used it for ourselves a few times now. They make great decorations, little toys or even a little learning aid. This free knitting pattern really is quick and easy to knit and then stitch up. They’re also a wonderful way to use up the odd little bits of yellow, black and white you may have lying around.",
