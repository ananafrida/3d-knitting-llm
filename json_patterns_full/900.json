  "full_text": "We love a good bandana in warmer weather—and this one is just that! It’s lightweight both in the knitting and in the wearing—and it’s a fun-to-work slip stitch pattern in an easily memorized eight-row repeat. Pack one for your travel knitting and take a finished bandana for your vacation wardrobe too—it’s the perfect piece for just a little something plush and colorful around your neck! SAMPLES SHOWN Completed bandana: Elmer in color Cashew and Birdie in color Plaid Is My Favorite Color. In-progress sample: Elmer Tweed in color Fir and Birdie in color Picnic. SIZES One size. FINISHED MEASUREMENTS Approx. 52” wingspan by 13” deep, after blocking. YARN REQUIREMENTS Please note these are yarn estimates. The amount used will depend on yarn, your personal gauge, and any modifications you make. MC: The Lamb & Kid Elmer (80% merino, 20% cashmere; 400 yards per 100 grams) OR The Lamb & Kid Elmer Tweed (70% merino, 30% cashmere; 410 yards per 100 grams): 1 skein. CC: The Lamb & Kid Birdie (74% alpaca, 26% silk; 328 yards per 50 grams): 1 skein. OR Two fingering-weight yarns in the following amounts: MC: 240 yards / 220m, CC: 105 yards / 96m. As ever, we invite you to play—this is a great pattern to use your stash—use multiple colors and work ripple stripes, or use all your leftovers and make it scrappy! NEEDLES Needles listed are suggested. Gauge Needle: US 6 (4mm) 24” / 60cm or 32” / 80cm circular needles. TOOLS Darning needle. GAUGE Gauge is not critical for this project although it may affect yardage requirements; you want a finished fabric with drape and body. Approx. 22 sts and 26 rows=4” in ripple slip stitch pattern using Gauge Needle, blocked. ERRATA, version 1: The stitch count after working Border Rows 1-3 is incorrect. The parenthetical note should read: Border Rows 1-3: … (2 sts inc’d, 285 sts on needle)",
