The Autumn League Pullover is a crewneck raglan sweater that evokes memories of Friday night football games, crisp fall evenings, and a general sense of nostalgia. The doubled ribbed neckband, v-insert neck triangle, and side slit details give personality and add to the classic appeal of this sweatshirt-inspired wardrobe staple.
