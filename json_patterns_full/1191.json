  "full_text": "This is a very simple beginner pattern that uses straight needles and your bits of leftover yarn. You can use any weight yarn with the appropriate size needles to create nice, firm, closely spaced stitches to accommodate the stuffing. This pattern used to be free, but I have added a little vest pattern to fit the gnomes and am asking just a small price to help support our family business. Thank you. Warm wishes, Tonya",
