  "full_text": "An impressive yet easy to knit scarf in the style of a great Italian designer. The chevrons are worked with single increases and decreases – no knots in your fingers trying to knit complicated double decreases and no double increases where the stitches get tight and hard to work with… Material: C1 - Lang Yarns Mille Colori Baby, Colour 51 (2 balls) C2 - Lang Yarns Mille Colori Baby, Colour 52 (2 balls) (Or any self striping fingering weight / sock yarn where the colour changes are not too fast or slow.) Knitting needle US 2½ - 3.0 mm Size of finished scarf : ca. 0.23 x 1.60 m (9 x 63 inches) Note: (January 2018) This is a free pattern that I uploaded more than three years ago. Please understand that I cannot offer any kind of pattern support anymore. I have answered all kinds of question on the comments pages, so please have a look there. Thanks for your understanding. Note: This Pattern is free. I hope it will bring a little bit of colour and joy into the world.
