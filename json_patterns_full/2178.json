  "full_text": "A crown knitted in the round, with each of the peaks worked separately. Sizing is pretty flexible: a small will fit a child with a head circumference up to about 16”. Medium will fit up to 20”, and large up to 24”. This was originally made with about 3/4 of a 45 yard mini-skein of MCN worsted, so the yarn requirements are pretty low! (I’m not sure exactly what the yardage is, but it is well under 45 yards.) I’ve had a few people message me for permission to use this pattern for various things, to which I mostly say go for it! If you use it to make things to sell, crediting the pattern would be nice, or if you feel like throwing me a couple of bucks, you can do that too. :smile: https://www.paypal.me/kayleighleblanc",
