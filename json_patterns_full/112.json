  "full_text": "These two cubes form a perpetual calendar. You can turn them around until you find the date you want. The numbers you need nicely fill all the faces on two cubes - which you might find a little surprising if you have never thought of it before. The pattern includes instructions for two versions. One is for stitching on plastic canvas so the cubes will be very light and maintain their shape. The other version is knitted. These can be filled with wood, foam, or plastic cubes, to keep their shape. They can double as juggling balls or stress-relieving balls if they are filled with something more fluid, like rice, polyester beads, ball bearings, etc. The cubes in the photos were made using DK yarn. Any thickness can be used. The size will vary according to the yarn chosen. Click spoiler if you want to know which numbers go on each cube. Cube 1: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Cube 2: 0, 1, 2, 6 (also 9), 7, 8",
