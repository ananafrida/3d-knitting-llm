  "description": "I wanted flat knitted leaves to decorate a tree, but didn’t want to be sewing them together or tying off the ends. I wound up with a small combination of crochet (chain and slip stitch only) to join the leaves together. This works well for me. The leaves are essentially flat, about 5cm (2 inches) long in the materials used. 50m makes a lot of leaves!",
