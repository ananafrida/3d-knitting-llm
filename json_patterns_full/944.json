  "description": "When my local prayer shawl ministry began knitting “prayer squares” for occasions when shawls were not ideal, either because of size or occasion, I began to think of details I would like to have in a prayer square. I wanted it to be easy, reversible, textural, and intuitive - and maybe just a bit addictive. This pattern is what resulted, though I keep finding ways to tweak things. The idea is simple enough to be incorporated into prayer shawls and dishcloths and other items. Go a bit crazy with it.",

  "full_text": "When my local prayer shawl ministry began knitting “prayer squares” for occasions when shawls were not ideal, either because of size or occasion, I began to think of details I would like to have in a prayer square. I wanted it to be easy, reversible, textural, and intuitive - and maybe just a bit addictive. This pattern is what resulted, though I keep finding ways to tweak things. The idea is simple enough to be incorporated into prayer shawls and dishcloths and other items. Go a bit crazy with it. This reversible prayer square features a double knit cross and a tassel. It is surprisingly easy to create, and uses just a tiny bit of yarn. Use 20 yards/10 grams of worsted weight leftovers from your favorite projects to create this quick and portable complement to a prayer shawl. Written directions are given, with periodic garter ridge counts for ease in reading your knitting. Notes are included for an optional spruced-up version that utilizes a crocheted cast on and slipped stitches at the beginning of every row, if you like finessing the details. Skills needed: reading knits and purls is helpful (although there is no purling involved! ) knit front and back slip slip knit weaving in tails Gauge is not important in this project You may share this free pattern for charity purposes.",
