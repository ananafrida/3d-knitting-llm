  "full_text": "Feather and Fan wavy baby blanket in gorgeous pastel colours. Instructions are given for basic feather and fan pattern together with pattern for a pastel rainbow baby blanket. This will enable users to make their own customised baby blanket. The example baby blanket I made used just under 300g of double knitting yarn and is approx 60cm x 90cm. Colours used: White - approx 100g Lilac - approx 50g Pink - approx 50g Peach - approx 50g Lemon - approx 50g Pale green - approx 50g Turquoise blue - approx 50g For the Reverse Pastel Rainbow baby blanket you will need approx 300g white and approx 100g colour. As with all stripey blankets, there will be ends to darn in but you can make it so much easier by weaving in as you go - there is a brilliant knitting-in ends tutorial from So, I Make Stuff",
