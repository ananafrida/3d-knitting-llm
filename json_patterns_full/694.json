  "full_text": "Worth mentioning - 10/8/14: Over the years lots of knitters have found this hat to run very small. This was my first pattern and the first yarn I worked with when writing up notes was a very squeaky acrylic. The gauges listed were what I found to be true for me. What I tend to recommend if you have plenty of yarn is to knit the middle size first. It’s a quick knit and when you figure out what size that makes with your yarn and your style of knitting, you’ll know whether to knit the next smaller or larger! You can always find a head to gift it to if it doesn’t fit your first intended recipient! ;) If you need larger than the written instructions for the large, add 10 stitches and a handful more rows for length before starting the decreases. If you like the pointier finish that the medium size makes, increase in multiples of 12 and follow the Menum instructions, adding more length before the decreases, as needed. The gauge shown is for the Medium Size in the suggested yarn. The Large size (on size US 8 needles) had a gauge of 10 sts and 13 rows per 2 inches. A quick and fun knit, popular for all ages in the fall.",
