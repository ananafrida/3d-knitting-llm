  "full_text": "The Owl Cable Stitch Knitting Pattern lets you create an adorable textured woodland creature. With this pattern, you’ll learn how to knit a square and add the unique cable stitch to your designs, whether flat or in the round. Bring your Great Horned Owl to life by adding craft buttons of your choice. Watch Video Tutorial https://youtu.be/wFCiI22Xvj8 Resting atop a reverse stockinette background, the outline of our owl’s body, head, and horns are knit in smooth stockinette cables. Within the body, we have extra textural interest in the Seed Stitch. Knitted Square Size: Thinner or thicker gauges of yarns, knit with appropriately sized needles, will yield either smaller or larger completed squares. • 6×6 inch square: Worsted #4 yarn with size 8US needles • 8×8 inch square: Bulky #5 yarn with size 10US needles (pictured samples) • 12×12 inch square: Super Bulky #6 yarn with size 11US needles Flat and In the Round: This pattern also includes written instructions to knit in the round. Try it out with either circular or double-pointed needles to include in hats, sweater sleeves, or infinity cowls. Blocking is Highly Recommended: Although blocking is optional, it is highly recommended to do so for best results. The stockinette stitch tends to curl within itself. Simply wet-blocking overnight will create a flat piece with beautifully shaped cables.",
