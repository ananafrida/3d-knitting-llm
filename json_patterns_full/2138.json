  "description": "I named this hat in honor of my favorite ghost town; Bankhead (1904-1922). Nestled in the heart of Banff National Park, you’ll miss it if you aren’t paying attention. It was an old mining town that extracted the coal from Cascade Mountain. The settlement has been abandoned for almost a century, yet all that remains today are a few foundations, coal heaps and the stairs that once lead up to the church. Well worth a visit despite its haunting feel.",

It was an old mining town that extracted the coal from Cascade Mountain. The settlement has been abandoned for almost a century, yet all that remains today are a few foundations, coal heaps and the stairs that once lead up to the church. Well worth a visit despite its haunting feel. The 2 parts of this hat remind me of the 2 sections of the town; upper and lower Bankhead, where the houses existed and the industrial area thrived. The simple pattern resembles the train tracks and mine shafts which scatter the mountainside. This hat would have been a favorite among these coal miners. Now includes 5 sizes Baby - Adult XL and smoother decreases!",
