  "full_text": "Little gift/storage pods. Decorated with a little loop at the top and toggle closure. Small: 10 cm/4 in. (Medium: 11.5 cm/4.5 in., Large: 12.5 cm/5 in.). Measurements are for length of opening. Requires 47 (59, 77) metres/51 (64, 84) yards of DK weight yarn. This is a beginner/easy level pattern. The pods are super simple to knit. All you need to know is how to cast-on, bind-off, knit and purl. The shape comes from the way they are sewn up, with just two easy straight seams. Pattern includes not only the knitting instructions, but tips for success, and assembly diagrams. Also includes sewing stitch instructions/tips, and comprehensive customisation information, so you can resize or adapt the basic pod design to work using different yarn weights and stitch patterns.",
