  "full_text": "This heart shape is perfect for Valentine’s Day and all year round as a gift to anyone you love! Download my “Knit Hearts Pattern Book” to get my Puffy Heart Softies printable pattern, along with 4 more of my popular designs in one printable digital e-book. This is a great way to support my work here at Studio Knit! WATCH STEP-BY-STEP VIDEO TUTORIAL Use any weight yarn and appropriately sized straight knitting needles for this quick knit project. Since stockinette stitch tends to curl, this pattern has the heart shape edging in garter stitch. And it is absolutely perfect to knit up as puffy hearts and softies. Once you have knitted up two of your heart shapes, to make up the front and back of your sachet, simply tack them together with the right side of your pieces facing together with yarn using your tapestry needle. Turn them inside out. Then fill them up with your either loose lavender, stuffing, or bits of yarn, and close them up. And you are done. A perfectly knitted heart softie. Your friends, family, and loved ones will cherish this thoughtful handmade gift made especially by YOU! I hope you give this fun quick knit project a try.",
