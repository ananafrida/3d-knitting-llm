  "description": "This is my first pattern so please let me know if anything needs fixed. This pattern is designed for any weight yarn and shows samples in worsted, chenille, and fingering. Just be sure you use needles that are comfortable with the yarn and don’t leave large gaps when stuffed. I do get small gaps next to the bobbles in this pattern but they can either be ignored or fixed with scrap yarn as they are quite small. I work this on Double Pointed needles, this has not been tested using the magic loop method but if you prefer that method and it works please let me know.",
