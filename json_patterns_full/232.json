  "description": "Simple can be beautiful, especially when sumptuous fibres (like merino and alpaca) are involved and a few tricks are thrown into the mix. This two-row scarf takes only 100g of fingering-weight yarn. I used a self-striping alpaca sock yarn, but you could easily use a merino hand-dyed semi-solid or even linen. If you’re looking for something suitable for “social” knitting that uses up stash luxury fibre and at the same time yields a smashing addition to your wardrobe, this is the perfect project.",
