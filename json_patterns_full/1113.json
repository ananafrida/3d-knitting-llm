  "full_text": "This pattern is simply a replica of a sweater from the Knives Out movie, reverse engineered for funsies in 10 sizes with 2 sleeve width options. It is a drop shoulder pullover, knit in pieces and seamed. SKILL LEVEL Intermediate to experienced. Must know basic garment construction, seaming, knitting in the round, following charts, knitting cables (with or without a cable needle.) At this point, many people have used this as their first sweater project, so don’t let me tell you what to do! :) NEEDLES A US 5 and a US 7 needle, circs or straights for the body. You’ll need a size 5 circ for knitting in the round on the collar, and a cable needle if that’s how you roll. But really just learn how to cable without a cable needle. Your life will be much better when you do. YARN ~2,500 yards of white DK or worsted weight yarn for XL . I’m using Blue Moon Fiber Arts Targhee Worsted in Snowflake, but I would encourage you to use any worsted weight yarn you like. FINISHED MEASUREMENTS Sleeves: See instructions for customization. Sizes: XS, (S, M, L,) XL, 2XL, 3XL, 4XL, 5XL, 6XL Chest circumference: 36, (40, 44, 48,) 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72” Width at the bottom hem: 17, (19, 21, 23,) 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35” Body length: 23, (24, 25, 26,) 27, 28, 29, X, X, X” - See notes on knitting this sweater to fit the length you would like.",
