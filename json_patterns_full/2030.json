Find all you need in terms of sizing, worksheet/pattern info, and helpful videos for each step of the process at Lift Bridge Yarns . ● Techniques used: Dividing a sock tube, picking up stitches, adding an afterthought heel, adding cuff ribbing, adding a toe. ● Two circular needles or double pointed needles a size or two smaller than you plan to knit with (for picking up stitches). ● Long circular needles or double pointed needles in your preferred sock knitting size. ● Gauge: Average knitters try a US 1, tight knitters try a US 1.5 or 2, loose knitters try a US 0. Try swatching with different needle sizes to match the gauge of your sock tube. As you knit more socks from tubes you’ll figure out which size needle works best for you. ● Scissors ● Tapestry needle",
