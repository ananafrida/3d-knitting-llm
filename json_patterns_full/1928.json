  "full_text": "The leaf is double-sided, knit in the round, with an i-cord as stem. There are three options: a main version (Variation A) and two modified versions (Variation B and C). The difference lies in how the increases are knitted. Variations A and B result in a solid fabric, while Variation C creates little decorative holes. Materials • Leftover yarn of any thickness (as a reference point: approx. 5 m with yarn of 50g/210m and 2.5 mm needles for one leaf) • 3 double-pointed needles (DPNs) in a size matching the yarn My little leaf journey started with the pattern „Just a leaf“ by Hinke, which is also a free pattern here on Ravelry. After knitting some leaves following those instructions, I began to modify the pattern to add more variety to the leaves. These variants are written down in this pattern. Update November 2024: The pattern by Hinke no longer available And no worries, if not all of your leaves look exactly the same; in nature, leaves come in different sizes too. Feel free to adjust the pattern and even knit various sizes on purpose. Happy knitting :-)",
