  "full_text": "This asymmetrical scarf will take out the chill of the day! Based on the stitch pattern in my Amsterdam Cowl pattern, it comes in two sizes: a petite wrap which makes a perfect little scarf, or a larger size which gives more coverage, like a shawl. The pattern can be reversible, so if gifted, you won’t see it worn the wrong way!! Using a size 4 needle or whatever size you use to fit the gauge, use your imagination to modify this pattern by switching colors after a full section is knit or knitting the YO, K2TOG rows by using a contrast color of silk mohair, Instructions for this are included! Instructions for beading are also added!! Finished Dimensions Small 22” x 47” Large 32” x 64”",
