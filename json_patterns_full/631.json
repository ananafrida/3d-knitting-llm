  "full_text": "MATERIALS 7 skeins of Blue Sky Fibers’s Worsted Cotton, 100% cotton. Each skein is 150 yards/ 100 grams; approximately 1050 yards required. A US 11 (8 mm), 24 or 32 inch circular needle Samples: We used Lemongrass, Lemonade, Bone, Tulip, Drift, Sleet, and Graphite for the Dandelion colorway and Indigo, Mediterranean, Caribbean, Tulip, Drift, Sleet and Ash for the Sky colorway. GAUGE 12 stitches = 4 inches in garter stitch, with yarn doubled FINISHED SIZE 26 x 33 inches NOTES For this pattern you’ll use the Worsted Cotton doubled. The best way to double yarn is to pull one strand from the inside of the ball and one strand from the outside. If you don’t have a swift and ball winder to wind a center-pull ball, never fear, you can do it by hand! Click here for a great video that shows you how! If you want to change the sizing or use this stitch pattern for a different project, just cast on a multiple of 14 plus 2 stitches.",
