  "full_text": "This pattern shows you how to knit a gathered circle, known as a yo-yo or Suffolk Puff. Instructions are given for my own version of a drawstring cast on which makes these simple to knit. The yo-yos are knitted in the round on short double pointed needles and can be made in various sizes, either by changing the weight of the yarn or the number of stitches. Details of this are in the pattern. I also show how different effects can be achieved, depending on how the circles are sewn together and explain how to turn the yo-yos into flowers. Finally, there are instructions for two projects made with my knitted yo-yos: a Very Hungry Caterpillar and a large patchwork table mat. All my ravelry patterns are free to download but, if you enjoy them, please consider making a donation to the British Liver Trust where the money will go to fund research and support the families of children with a liver disease. You can do this easily by going to my fundraising page here Happy Knitting!",
