  "full_text": "Made in homage to our favorite Daddyo! The Orville Peck Mask is knit flat in garter stitch with in-pattern bind-offs + a cable cast on for the eyeholes. Fringe along the bottom and ribbon ties at the sides are added after knitting. You’ll need US 5 (3.75mm) 16” circulars or straights Tapestry needle Scrap yarn for putting stitches on hold Ribbon Yardage 30 yards/28 meters heavy worsted/Aran for mask Sample used Caron Simply Soft in 13 Black 50 yards/55 meters fingering weight* for fringe Sample used Cascade 220 Fingering in 1032 Lavendula A different weight can be used, but a different number of tassels will be needed. An acrylic or wool yarn is recommended for the mask because they hold their shape well, but choose any yarn that knits up densely in the stated gauge and is available to you. A baby yarn would work well for sensitive skin. Gauge 21 stitches and 42 rows = 4x4 inches/10x10 centimeters in garter stitch knit flat, using US size 5/3.75mm needles or size needed to obtain gauge Sizing Width: 9 ½ inches/24 centimeters Height: 3 ¼ inches/8.5 centimeters The mask is one size. The idea here is that the bottom of the mask should cover the tip of your nose, and the sides should cover your cheeks but stop before your ears. if you have a longer face, you can knit more rows before you start on the eyeholes. if you have a wider face, cast on extra stitches to the sides. The mask is quick to knit and easy to try on as you go, so you can adjust your size as needed without too much fuss. Go get ‘em, cowboy!",
