  "full_text": "This pattern came about because “Sockalongers” (people taking part in the Winwick Mum Sockalong) who were meeting up wanted something they could wear to recognise each other. Wanting to avoid the red carnation and newspaper cliche, we went instead for a sock - of course! And here it is - a teeny tiny sock for wearing as a brooch or to create a bag charm, key ring or even a Christmas decoration. Always better than waving a pair of your hand knits so that people can recognise you!",
