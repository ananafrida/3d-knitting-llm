  "full_text": "I love the thought of a mini bonfire! The idea of giant and tiny being side by side. I guess everything is gigantic if you’re as tall as a blade of grass! How fun it would be to see wee folk gathered round a mini bonfire. This is a fun, easy project! The basic idea is that you are knitting i-cords logs and attaching fringe flames to them. There are 2 size options; a small mini bonfire and a tall mini bonfire. To make the tall bonfire you have to make both. Because they stand independently they look fantastic on display. Currently my witches are on my mantle staring into their mini bonfire! How fun it is to watch the flames dance! Praise for Mini Bonfire I found the pattern to be very well-written, with clear instructions and plenty of photos and explanations to guide each step. The design is both creative and fun to work on, and the attention to detail really stands out. ( mallacrochet )",
