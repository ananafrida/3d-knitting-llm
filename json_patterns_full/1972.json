  "full_text": "This pattern comes with a full step-by-step video tutorial linked here . Download the pattern for free and knit alongside the video perfect for beginners. If you know how to work a knit stitch and a purl stitch you can knit this cardigan. INTRODUCTION This cardigan is knit flat in separate panels. Start by knitting the individual front and back panels, then join them at the shoulder with an invisible seam. Next, along the armhole edge pick up stitches for the sleeves and knit them each down to the cuff. Finally, bring it all together with a mattress seam to close each half of the cardigan. SIZING Sizes 1 (2, 3, 4){5, 6} This cardigan is designed to be oversized. I recommend choosing a size that is 4-10” {10-25.5 cm} larger than your actual bust circumference Bust Circumference: 38.5 (42, 45.5, 50.5){54, 58.5} inches, {98 (107, 116, 128){137, 149} cm} Note: This cardigan is worn open in the front.
