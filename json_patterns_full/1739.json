  "full_text": "Called the Citrus Hat for the way the decreases create the appearance of a citrus fruit, this is a pretty basic hat pattern that works well with pretty much any yarn and can fit multiple head sizes. It looks great in handspun or commercial yarn, and in solid, semi-solid, or variegated colorways. The combination of knits and purls used throughout the hat means it is very accommodating of different head sizes and a good match for kids that keep growing. While the pattern is written for worsted-weight yarn, it’s easy to adjust for different yarn weights, and the pattern includes some helpful hints for yarn modifications. The pattern includes sizes for baby, toddler, child/teenager, small adult, and large adult hats.",
