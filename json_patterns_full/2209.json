Both are huge fans of Zelda, and they are expecting their first child very soon. After posting it on Craftster I was absolutely blown away by the response it received—over 30,000 hits in just one week, and before long dozens of blogs from Geekologie.com to Kotaku.com and even GayGamer.net wrote about my nerdy little outfit! (I love the GayGamer logo, by the way! Would it be inappropriate to call it fabulous?) “ Errata: Step 16 (Tunic bottom flare) All Even Rounds for Needle 1 should be: k1 p1 kfb, (k1, p1) until last 2 sts on needle, kfb, work in patt to end.",
