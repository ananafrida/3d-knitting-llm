  "full_text": "“Hello, Rabbit,” he ( Pooh ) said, “Is that you?” “Let’s pretend it isn’t,” said Rabbit, “And see what happens“. Oh dear - is it a good idea to bring Wabbit into the group of my knitted Pooh characters?! Knitting-wise Wabbit is knitted and shaped with short rows and pick up stitches - as are all of my patterns. I’ve listed the yarn I knitted Wabbit in within the pattern but you can adapt yarn choices to suit yourself - there is also a KIT available HERE And if you’d like to knit Piglet then that pattern is here - ( Also don’t forget Pooh - he’s here And Roo - who’s free here And of course Eeyore who’s here there’s also a kit for him too There is of course - Tigger! and lastly Wol - here (also free!) I hope you love your Wabbit as much as I love mine… and follow along with my Instagram @doptpebbles_knits for the last up and coming other character to complete this series !",
