When I purchased this skein I assumed this would be what the pattern for it was, but really they had designed it for a hat, using the animal head as a pom pom. So needs must. I used less than 1 skein of the yarn, and my lovie is about 8” from the middle to the edge (on a side, not a corner). You could use any weight of yarn with an appropriate needle for that size, or any worsted weight yarn.",
