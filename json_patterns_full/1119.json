  "description": "The ginkgo (or gingko) is such an odd tree, it’s considered a living fossil! The ginkgo is a symbol of many good things: hope, resilience (a ginkgo survived an atomic bomb with little damage), peace, longevity (a ginkgo can live 1000 years), strength, a time of balance and control, etc.",

  "full_text": "The ginkgo (or gingko) is such an odd tree, it’s considered a living fossil! The ginkgo is a symbol of many good things: hope, resilience (a ginkgo survived an atomic bomb with little damage), peace, longevity (a ginkgo can live 1000 years), strength, a time of balance and control, etc. This pattern works up quickly with very little yarn. It’s a great way to use up bits of yarn in your stash. A knit ginkgo leaf would make a great decoration on keyrings, backpacks, gift boxes or bags. The leaf is 3.75 inches wide and 2.5 inches long blocked to gauge without the stem. It takes less than 2 hours to knit a leaf. Skills needed: cast on, slip, knit, German turn (or use your favorite turn technique) and bind off in knit stitch. Optional: I-cord stem Gauge is not important in this pattern. Any block-able yarn/thread will work. Make a swatch to check gauge and appearance. 14 yards of Koigu’s KPM or KPPPM yarn will make 1 leaf with stem at gauge.",
