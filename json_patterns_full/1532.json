  "full_text": "Knit your own pumpkin in a choice of textures and sizes! Mini/Small/Medium Garter Stitch, Stockinette, Ribbed & Slip Stitch Pumpkin Scrap yarn is great for this project! Aim for about Aran weight yarn or slightly thicker. Combining different colour and weight yarns gives great dimension for the pumpkins, i.e. 3 strands of 4-ply, a strand of 4-ply and DK, two strands of DK etc or variegated/speckled/colour changing Aran weight yarn bring great natural looking results. You will only need a very small amount of yarn for each pumpkin, approximately 15g for the mini, 30g for the small and 45g for the medium one. This pattern was created for our knit group and they enjoyed it so much more that we’ve decided to share it here! Feel free to use this pattern to make and sell the pumpkins.",
