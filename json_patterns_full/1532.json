I designed this cowl to be an ideal first knitting project. I have made a series of videos showing all the techniques but I'm afraid these are all in Spanish. If you are still interested in watching them, you can find them at www.tejereningles.es/aprende-tejer-1, but you can still follow the pattern without watching the videos.",
