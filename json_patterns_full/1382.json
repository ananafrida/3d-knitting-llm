The day is filled with fun activities to celebrate the end of the long, cold winter, and finishes with the traditional axing of the beards. When the last beard has been axed, the Gnomehaughen Fiber Festival begins! These finger-sized gnomes are a super- quick, easy knit. They are knit in the round on dpns from the bottom to the top with a bobble nose and I-cord arms.",

( Saphiera ) Super Fun Quick Knit. ( RandyRatCraft ) Using little bits of scrap yarn, he only took a tiny amount and only a little time to knit. ( Bogwoppit ) Cute little gnomes. They are having so much fun meeting, fishing and bringing joy to the world. ( Omissi ) The pattern is very well written, with lots of pictures and explanations. ( mallacrochet ) OMG; I love HIM and he will perch nicely upon a Pencil ( RandyRatCraft ) This little fellow gave me a break from urgent chores. He is a such a hairy fellow it is hard to see his face, but he does have one. ( Heptonstall ) His beard is so unruly! He needs a good shearing. At present, however, he is refusing. His beard gives him “character.” ( Teeliebhaberin )",
