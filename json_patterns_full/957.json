  "description": "Make your dollhouse cozy and create a hygge atmosphere for your Maileg friends and dolls by knitting as many carpets as possible! Both Tiny rug and Big carpet are knitted using so called slip stitch pattern. This pattern looks differently from both sides so carpets are reversible and looks beautiful also when combining more yarn colours. You can either follow the number of stitches and rows recommended or you can opt for your own number creating carpets of various sizes!",
