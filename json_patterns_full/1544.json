(also frog pouffe) Knitted flat with chunky yarn to create a rather squishy everlasting orange or natural coloured seasonal fruit (I know, ‘fruit’, I didn’t know that until recently!) I’ve give the yarn type that I’ve used - but you can use any yarn you wish - the bulkier the better in this case I think. Also - if you’re more of a visual person: THERE IS A QUICK REEL / VIDEO HERE IF YOU NEED TO VISUALISE IT: http://www.instagram.com/reel/CjXddi0IHqd/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link P.S - frog pattern here: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/frog-48 and Puppy - https://tinyurl.com/bdhpnpn8",
