  "full_text": "Northwest Elf is a pattern designed for the whimsical. The pattern is written for two different weights of yarn, bulky and worsted depending on your preference. The pattern is written in two separate patterns, so you don’t have to read #’s in parenthesis. For Bulky Version (in photo): Knit picks Billow in natural for the ribbing and tassel, Knit pick City Tweed DK held double in emerald for the body. You will need US 9 & 10 16” circ’s and US 10 DPN’s. I used two skeins of the DK and held the yarn double which used less than a full skein of each. If you are using another bulky weight yarn I would make sure you have at least 100 yds of your main color. For worsted version (photos coming soon): Cascade 220 superwash (or worsted of your choice) with US 7 & 8 16” circ’s and US 8 DPN’s. Approx 200 yards of worsted weight req. If you haven’t yet mastered the icord, this is a perfect opportunity to learn. You can vary the length of your cord before adding the tassel depending on how “elvish” you are feeling!",
