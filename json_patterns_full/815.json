  "full_text": "Two small illusion hearts - one to be viewed from the bottom, the other from the side. These are quick and easy as they are only 41 stitches wide. They measure about 20 cm (8”) square. Individually they could be used as dishcloths or mats. You could use a series of them to make a scarf, bag, or part of a garment. Four squares could make a cushion, or even more can make an afghan. Reverse the colours in some squares for a more interesting effect. When you look directly at the squares you only see stripes. The hearts are revealed when you look from an angle. The motifs in the photos were made using Stylecraft Special DK in Lipstick and White. You can use any yarn but a different thickness will probably change the overall size. Using DK you will need approximately 30 metres (33 yards) of each colour, for each square. Extra is needed for the borders.",
