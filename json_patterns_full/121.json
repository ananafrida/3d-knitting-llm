  "full_text": "I was looking for a pattern for simple, 2” blocks to knit. I found lots of patterns, but none was quite what I wanted, so I just sat down with needles and yarn and put this together. I hope you like it! As you can see, I chose to embroider uppercase letters on my blocks. If you wish to do the same, just pick a stitch you like (I used the lazy daisy chain stitch ) and go for it! You may stuff with fiberfill, if you wish. I wanted a little more structure, so I cut up 2” upholstery foam to put inside my blocks. I really like it a lot better than using fiberfill for this project. Disclaimer: For all the complaining I did about cutting the foam, it really isn’t hard. DO NOT let that stop you. My complaining is because I wanted my cubes to be 100% perfect, like me…lol! But really, it’s not hard, I promise. You can totally do it! :) Any worsted-weight yarn will do. As a matter of fact, ANY yarn can work! Just make sure that when you knit your squares, they will cover a side of your cube, plus an extra row/column for seaming. Have fun with it!",
