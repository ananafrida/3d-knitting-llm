  "full_text": "As the air turns crisp and the leaves begin to fall, there’s nothing quite like bringing the warmth of autumn into your home with a handmade touch. These adorable, knitted pumpkins are the perfect cosy project for those quiet evenings by the fire or a rainy afternoon with a cup of tea in hand. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced knitter, this pattern offers a versatile and fun way to create your own seasonal décor. You can choose to knit your pumpkin flat or in the round—whatever feels best to you! With the flexibility to use any weight yarn, from light and delicate to thick and chunky, you can truly make each pumpkin your own. You can even hold two yarns together to create a rich, marled effect or a thicker, squishy fabric. The possibilities are endless, so feel free to get creative with colours, textures, and sizes. Let’s get started on filling your home with handmade charm this fall! MATERIALS Yarn of your choice. For one pumpkin you will need approx 8 - 14 m / 9 – 15 yds of yarn Needles and Notions: If knitting in the round use circular needles long enough for magic loop or double pointed needles. You want a tight fabric, so use a needle size that quite small for your yarn, as a guide: Sock weight yarn: 2.0 mm (US 1) needles Sock weight yarn held double: 3.25 mm (US 3) needles Worsted weight yarn: 3.25 – 3.5 mm (US 3-4) Chunky weight yarn: 5.0 mm (US 8) GAUGE There is no set gauge, but I have put some needle recommendations for different types of yarn. However, it will depend on whether you are a loose or tight knitter. You want your knitting to come out quite dense as you will be stuffing them and stretching the knitting a bit. SIZE This will depend on your yarn, gauge, stuffing and how much you cinch your pumpkin, as a guide: Sock weight: 2.5 cm / 1 inch across. Worsted weight: 4.5 cm / 1¾ inches across. Chunky weight: 6.5 cm / 2½ inches across.",
