  "full_text": "The Boulevard Blanket….it’s quick, easy, chunky, warm and reversible! At first glance you might think this pattern is just simple garter stitch. Look again! An easy K3, P3 repeat pattern creates a subtle striping effect. The name of this pattern is inspired by the beautiful tree lined boulevards of my hometown….Kansas City. For more info see my blog post at FiftyFourTenStudio.com . Once in a while knitters have trouble getting on track with this pattern. I have created a free PDF tutorial for The Boulevard Blanket to address the most common mistakes. SIX SIZES: Baby/Infant Blanket: 28” wide x 28” long Small (Crib/Lap): 35” wide x 40” long Medium Throw: 38” wide x 46” long Large Throw: 44” wide x 50” long XL Afghan: 47” wide x 55” long XXL Afghan: 53” wide x 60” long SUPER BULKY YARN: Baby: 320 - 330 yards Small: 590 - 600 yards Medium: 730 - 740 yards Large: 925 - 940 yards XL: 1100 - 1150 yards XXL: 1350 - 1400 yards This pattern is knit with super bulky yarn so you’ll have this blanket knit up in no time. If you prefer a lighter weight yarn (worsted weight or similar) see my free Meadow Lane blanket knitting pattern . NEEDLES: The blanket is knit in one piece, back and forth on 32” long circular knitting needles US size 13 or 15. GAUGE: Exact gauge is not essential. However, knitting should be fairly tight for desired appearance. SKILL LEVEL: Beginner / Easy You will need to know how to cast on stitches, knit and purl confidently, bind of stitches and weave in ends. This pattern is written in standard U.S. knitting terms.",
