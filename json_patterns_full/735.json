  "full_text": "The patchwork relay is a joint effort for everyone. There is a new pattern from a podcaster every month, this is a free pattern. You can knit in any yarn and the needle size you think suits your choice of yarn. This can eventually become a patchwork quilt or you can knit the patches in cotton yarn which become beautiful cloths. The idea is that together we will design and knit beautiful rugs and/or cloths.",
