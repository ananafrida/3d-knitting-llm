The blanket is made up of 48 squares, a border and an edging, each featuring a different stitch pattern or technique so the whole project is a masterclass in knitting. As well as written instructions, charts are included for each of the squares. This stitch pattern consists of tiny bobbles, sprinkled over the surface of the knitting and, fittingly, I’ve called it ‘Sprinkles’. All my ravelry patterns are free to download but, if you enjoy them, please consider making a donation to the British Liver Trust where the money will go to fund research and support the families of children with a liver disease. You can do this easily by going to my fundraising page here Happy Knitting!",
