  "full_text": "Needs just 60-70 yards of 5ply sport weight 100% wool for this one: the properties of the pure wool fibre assist in speeding up the ripening process for the avocado. Two styles of sack included: one with a ribbed top for simplicity, and one with an enclosed double drawstring that won’t slide open on its own. According to the theory: a storebought unripe avocado can be evenly ripened and ready to eat in just 24 hours if you store it in a bag like this. No more impatiently waiting for days, or leaving it too long and finding it inedible and spoiled inside. You will need 3mm & 3.5mm needles on a 20cm cable (or your favourite sock needle setup); also DPNs or a longer cable to magic loop the base. Sized to fit small, medium, or large avocados easily. Make a set for yourself and whip up some more for gifts! having problems purchasing designs from my store? please visit this link for some solutions to the issue https://www.ravelry.com/designers/handmade-by-smine",
