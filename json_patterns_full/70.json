  "full_text": "As my store name suggests, I am not really a knitter, I specialise in crochet design… However, I decided to take on a charity challenge to knit every day in October 2022. I hadn’t picked up knitting needles for many years, but I did remember making simple corner-to-corner garter stitch squares years ago, and figured that would be an easy project. I also added a simple crochet moss-st edging, but you could add your own favourite knitted border if you prefer. So many people have asked me for the pattern, that I thought I had better write it up! Yarn Requirements You can use any yarn you wish, just make sure the needles you use are appropriate to the yarn. I used a collection of DK (#3 weight) yarn scraps (mainly Stylecraft Special DK) from my stash, and 4.5mm needles. Each square uses around 25m of yarn in total, weighing around 8g when worked with the Special DK",
