  "full_text": "My cloud design is the third instalment in my series of pandemic knitting patterns. It joins a rainbow and sunshine in a collection of free knitting patterns. Since lockdown has been lifted, almost everyone I’ve chatted to has said they’ve struggled with their mental health or have felt burnt out. I know I certainly have. The cloud is a reminder that mental health is so important. The cloud knitting pattern is free, as I wanted to be available to everyone, but if you’d like to donate to the mental health charity Mind please visit my Just Giving page here . My suggested donation is £4, which is what I would usually charge for a knitting pattern. You can also buy materials bundles for the kits here , and a portion of the sales of the kits go to Mind. The cloud can be knitted in different sizes. The sizes available in the pattern are DK, chunky and super chunky. Recommended materials for all three sizes are listed in the pattern. SKILL LEVEL: Easy - Intermediate, for knitters who know the basics.",
