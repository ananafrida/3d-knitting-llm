  "full_text": "A rainbow of bunnies, filled with catnip to treat your kitty at Easter. Pattern has only the tiniest amount of seaming on the ears, otherwise it’s seam free and knitting on two needles. Pattern is written up (badly - I’m a novice!) on my blog, with lots of pictures to make it even easier. Update - now available as a Ravelry pdf download :) This would also be a great pattern to knit for young children - a string of them as a pram toy, or to learn colours etc. Edited to add: Please feel free to make these to raise funds for charity. :)",
