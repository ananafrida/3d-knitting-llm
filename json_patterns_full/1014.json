  "full_text": "This “pattern” is really more of a guide to creating your own and customizing your own little monster using whatever scraps you have on hand. This requires using an invisible cast-on that gives you a closed end, such as Turkish or Judy’s Magic Cast-on . This was a really easy little monster. I did a Turkish cast-on, knit around, switching colors in the middle, stuck in the safety eyes and polyfil then grafted closed. I made the ears by doing a running stitch diagonally across the corners and pulling closed. His teeth are duplicate stitch.",
