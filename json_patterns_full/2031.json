  "full_text": "Difficulty level ●○○○○ The instructions are only for the tip. There are different versions of the sling star tip. Since I've been asked several times how I knit the sling star lace, I've written it down for you. There are charts for 60/64/68/72 stitches. This way you can see directly how many laps you have to plan for the top. As the charts speak for themselves, I have only translated the abbreviations into English.",
