  "full_text": "Description from Knitty, Summer 2003: I designed this bag to wear slung across the chest, keeping your hands free. Perhaps it can carry your latest small project to the shore or to the park on a Saturday morning. Tasha could even hold your yarn while you stand and knit, waiting for the train or the weekend beach bus. The denim yarn wears well and has a faded, comfortable look. The Loose Five-Rib Braid Cable was taken from Barbara Walker's Second Treasury of Knitting Patterns .",
