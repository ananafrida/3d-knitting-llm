Tom Turkey holiday hats that your enter goof ball holiday guest here has worn in the past, this Pom Pom Gnome is ready to add some excitement to your Thanksgiving holiday. Add a Tom Turkey to your centerpiece, make a rafter of Tom Turkeys (did you know a group of turkeys is called a ‘rafter’) and use them as name card holders at each place setting, or gift one to your favorite teacher or holiday hostess. This pattern includes instructions for the knitted hat, knitted turkey legs, pom pom, i-cord legs, and assembly. A link to download the pattern will be emailed to you after you check out.",
