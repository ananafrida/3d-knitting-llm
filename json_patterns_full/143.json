  "full_text": "This pattern was part of a project to build a giant model of the perovskite crystal structure using knitting and crochet. Read about the project here . NB: The project ended in 2013. Notions: Toy stuffing, cardboard to reinforce the octahedron shape, sewing needle and thread. (Note: Cardboard from a cereal box should be sufficient.) Companion to the Perovskite Project - Central Atom pattern.",
