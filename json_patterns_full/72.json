  "full_text": "Ankylosaurus, Late Cretaceous 68-66mya. A herbivorous dinosaur covered in armoured plates and with a club at the end of its tail. It was about 25 feet in length and weighed about 6 tons. You will need two skeins of yarn in contrasting colours, 145-155 yd of each. My square weighs c.55 grams. The pattern is 47sts by 58 rows done in double knitting, and comes out at 10 inches square on 4mm needles. You could use thicker yarn and larger needles for a larger square if you wish.",
