  "full_text": "I needed a project to use up some of my super bulky first few skeins of homespun yarn. I just cast on some stitches for a hat and started knitting… before I knew it I had this cute Pixie/Gnome Hat. The super bulky yarn worked great. It gives it so much structure the hat stays pointy. This is a fun, fast knit. Enjoy!",
