  "full_text": "4 size 6 double pointed needles are used through out. I designed this little doll during the Covid 19 isolation. I decided to share the pattern and to shoot the videos to share with other knitters. I thought I might share some knitting joy in this scary time. I used scrap yarns..so some weights are a little lighter than worsted weight, but with the stranded work..it thickens up those sections. This is for the knitter who has some experience with stranded work…because I don’t teach that in this pattern. My website is down for a short time right now, January 25 2022….it will be back up soon.",
