  "full_text": "Join the Skeinwalker Fall KAL (Oct. 20th to Nov. 20th)! Knit a Skeinwalker pattern in good company! Skeinwalker is hosting a KAL from October 20th to November 20th, 2025! Whether you’re trying a Skeinwalker pattern for the first time or you’re a longtime knitter, whether you choose a quick cowl or an ambitious shawl – you’re welcome! Bring your needles, your enthusiasm, and your sense of adventure and let’s knit together! You can join the Skeinwalker Fall KAL with any Skeinwalker pattern . Come and check out Skeinwalker Yarns! They are available for purchase on Payhip ! Crystalline waters stretch between emerald islands. Sheltered lagoons hide their colorful waters like jewels waiting for the light. The turquoise depths shift from aquamarine to deeper teal, creating a living canvas that changes with each passing cloud. Seabirds trace graceful arcs through salt-tinged air, hopping effortlessly from island to island. The Lagunîs cowl captures this turquoise journey. Lace panels mirror bird wings in flight, while diamond-shaped motifs echo the view of lagoons from above. Generous yarn-overs create the airy lightness of ocean breezes. The lace flows and merges like converging currents. Wrap yourself in the serenity of protected waters and let Lagunîs transport you to that perfect moment between sea and sky. The name Lagunîs is a word play that weaves together “lagoon”, “island” and “sea,” while the distinctive circumflex accent over the “î” pays homage to the French word “île” (island). For best effect, use a smooth, round yarn with reasonable stitch definition. Yarn weights ranging from Fingering to Aran would be suitable. As for colorways, I would recommend solid, semi-solid, speckled, or gradient (single skein or gradient set) yarns. Do you like the Lagunîs cowl? You might like those patterns too: The Éolia scarf / stole, and the Glasmålning cowl. For endless fun with flowy lace with airy yarn-overs! Check them out!
