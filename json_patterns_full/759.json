The leaf section is larger and the dart section is smaller than the original. I also omitted Weldon’s partial darts. The afghan block is 5.5 inches square at gauge. Skills needed: cast on, slip, knit, purl, YO, k2tog, SSK, M1 (make 1) and SK2P. Gauge is not important in this pattern. Any block-able yarn/thread will work. Make a swatch to check gauge and appearance.",
