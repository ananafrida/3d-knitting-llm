The body and sleeves of the sweater are worked seamlessly top-down with optional waist shaping. The collar is picked up from the provisional cast-on edge and can be knit to any length. This pattern is best suited for advanced beginners. Model is wearing a size 2 with waist shaping. SIZING The Regina pullover is designed to be worn with approximately 0-2 in / 0-5 cm of negative ease, meaning the circumference of the pullover is approximately 0-2 in / 0-5 cm smaller than your bust. When the collar is unstretched, it is intended to have 8.5-11 in / 21.5-28 cm of negative ease at the horizontal circumference of your body below the shoulders (specifically at the top of the crease where your arms separate from your body).

You will need approximately 30-50 yards / (27-35 meters) less if you choose to work waist shaping. For this garment, it is recommended to use a wool, wool-blend or a fiber with some elasticity. Plant based yarns (like 100% cotton) will not retain its shape once stretched which is needed to ensure the pullover stays up on your shoulders, especially for the collar.
