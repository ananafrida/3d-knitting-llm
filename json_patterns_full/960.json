  "full_text": "My son wanted to sell hackey sacks at his school fair and after many attempts at getting the size correct this is the pattern for them. I stuffed them with bear pellets, available from craft shops, you could use beans, rice or wheat. A bit of patience is required with the first few rows, knitting a bit looser than normal helps until all the stitches are increased. A great pattern for using up those scraps of leftover yarns.",
