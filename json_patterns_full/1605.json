  "full_text": "Your first cardigan from this pattern will not be your last! You will love the ease of knitting a V-neck cardigan without going back to pick up stitches for the button band afterwards - hooray! V-neck cardigans are traditionally worn by boys, but don’t let them have all the fun! Choose your yarn color and buttons to add a versatile sweater to any baby’s wardrobe, boy or girl! The pattern offers you three sizes, Newborn, 6 and 12 months using dk weight yarn. Other weight yarns will work, changing your needles to accommodate your yarn. The size of your finished work will reflect the change you make. If you are looking for bigger sizes, Oh Kiddo! Cardi offers sizes 2-12! A 6 month cardigan will use most of a 100 gram (220 yard) skein. For size 12 month you will need about 30 yards more. Solids or yarns with slight color variation are recommended. I like a super wash wool, or a wool blend as baby wear needs to be washed with little fuss and bother. OOPS! Sleeves: Row 1- stitch count is 32(36, 40). I forgot to subtract the two decreases from the set up row instructions.",
