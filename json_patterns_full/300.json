  "full_text": "No specific gauge. Any Yarn, with smaller needles than usually required for a denser fabric. This little guy has all the attributes of a monster – the beady, close-set eyes, the vapid and uncomprehending stare, the little devil horns (that I’m sure, if he had hair, he would wear it in an artfully arranged comb-over to hide his true nature) and tiny, tiny hands, knuckles dragging on the ground. The perfect thing to make from scraps that you probably could (should?) throw in the bin, or scraps of colours you are not keen on. For me, orange is the most loathsome colour. Never been a fan. In this case, the colour envokes orange cats, who are said to all share the same brain-cell. Little Orange Monster Man and his monster friends, no matter their colour, are probably the same. Personally, my favourite variation is DK weight yarn on 2.5mm needles, which makes a small pincushion, because inserting the needles? Sooooo satisfying. Perfect as a small gift for your like-minded friends, but equally as subversive for your not-like-minded frenemies.",
