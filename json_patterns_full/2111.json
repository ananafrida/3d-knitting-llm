  "full_text": "NOTE: The original PDF has been replaced with the corrected version which was kindly ‘professionalized’ by a fellow Raveler. This is a pattern for a jacket now written in several sizes so the whole family can go “Spidey” crazy. It has spiderman motifs on the back and both of the sleeves. The original jacket was knit with Knit Picks Wool of the Andes yarn but any worsted yarn can be substituted. There are 4 colors of yarn required; blue(600-1400yd),red(300-400yd),black(100 yd) and white(50 yd). A separating zipper which can be trimmed to fit about 1/2” below the top of the collar is needed. The pattern includes a schematic and 3 motif charts. The knitter should have some experience working in intarsia and stranded knitting but I would encourage someone who is new to color knitting to make the sweater with just one of the spiderman motifs. SPIDEY HAT - A General Recipe - written for circular needles Please refer to the free Web Spinner pattern for the hat chart which is labelled B and was originally used for the sleeve. The abbreviations are also included in this pattern. To determine the depth of the hat simply measure from just below the ear to the middle of the top of the head. This measurement is the length from the CO to the beginning of the decrease rounds. I have based all of the sizes from baby to a large adults over a 108 stitch cast on which allows 4 of the 27 stitch repeats from the chart. These measurements are based on the suggested needle sizes which are stated on the yarn label, but if you want the hat to fit perfectly, please KNIT A SWATCH! I can’t emphasize this enough as you don’t want to put a lot of energy into a project which might end up looking like a cupcake sitting on the recipient’s head, or on the opposite end of the scale, cascading down over the eyes, which definitely doesn’t make Spidey appear like the cool dude that he is! Fingering Wt Yarn - based on 7 stitches/inch using a 2.25 to 3.00mm needle Finished circumference: 15.5” Sport Weight - 6 stitches/inch using a 2.75 to 3.5mm needle - 18” circumference Double Knit Weight - 5.5 stitches/inch using a 3.25 to 4.0mm needle - 20” Worsted Weight - 5 stitches/inch using a 3.75 to 4.5mm needle - 21.5” Aran Weight - 4.5 stitches/inch using a 4.0 to 5mm needle - 24” Chunky Weight - 4 stitches/inch using a 5.00 to 6.00mm needle 27” You will need a small amount of black yarn and some red or blue or both; the choice is up to you With the smaller circular needle, CO 108 stitches in either red or blue. Mark the beginning of the round and rib 12 rows as follows: 3 rounds in purl, 3 rounds in knit, 3 rounds in purl, 3 rounds in knit. After completing the edging, switch to the larger needle and with the Black yarn, purl 2 rounds. You will begin the sleeve chart at row19 and continue for 19 rounds until you complete row 38. Feel free to eliminate the little lines and motifs which surround the actual spider if you want to simplify the chart. To complete this section, once again purl 2 rounds in black. Now you will begin the stocking stitch rounds using the color of your choice. On the 1st round decrease 4 stitches evenly and knit every round until you reach the predetermined depth of your cap. On the last round, place a marker every 13 stitches to prepare for the following decrease rounds: Please note that sm means slip marker Round 1 - k2tog,(k9,ssk,sm,k2tog) x7, k9, ssk - 88 st. Round 2 and all even rounds - knit a complete round Round 3 - k2tog,(k7,ssk,sm,k2tog) x7, k7,ssk - 72 st Round 5 - k2tog,(k5,ssk,sm,k2tog) x7,k5,ssk - 56 st Round 7 - k2tog,(k3,ssk,sm,k2tog) x7,k3,ssk - 40 st Round 9 - k2tog,(k1,ssk,sm,k2tog) x7,k1,ssk - 24 st Round 11 - (slip 1 st as if to knit, k2tog, pass the slipped stitch over the k2tog) x 8 Cut the yarn leaving a 6” tail and thread this yarn through the remaining 8 stitches. Fasten off securely inside the hat. Now wear with ATTITUDE!",
