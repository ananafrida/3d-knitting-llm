  "full_text": "Espace Tricot is a yarn store in Montreal, Canada. Discover our yarns here! www.espacetricot.com FLYING SOLO is a chic and minimalist unisex ribbed cowl knit with three colours of Artfil Solo. Two strands are held together throughout the project with one strand being changed at a time to create a series of ombre stripes. The cowl is knit from the bottom up with the front and back flap knit separately and then joined to knit in the round. While we chose a neutral palette, we think this cowl would be stunning worked up with a series of saturated and/or speckled hand-dyed Solo colourways in brights and jewel tones. Artfil Solo is a lusciously soft single-ply merino and is a perfect choice for accessories and garments that will be worn next to the skin.",
