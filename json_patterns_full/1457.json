These tiny sweaters are fun to knit and even more fun to gift. Make them as ornaments, or package toppers. Stick one on top of a bottle of wine as a gift, or use them as cozies for soft boiled eggs. Yarn: Scraps of sock/fingering weight yarns in various colors. Little sweater takes 24 yards of yarn, not including embellishment. Gauge: 9 stitches and 13 rows per 1 inch (2.5cm) square. But gauge is less important in this context. Change needles to get a fabric you like. Needles: Set of 2.5mm (US1.5) double pointed needles or size needed to get a fabric you like. Finished size: Laid flat, sweater is 4 inches (10 cm) from sleeve to sleeve and 1 7/8 inches (5.75cm) wide at chest, and 2 1/4 inches (5.5cm) from neck to hem. Notions: 3 on-needle stitch markers, one pin-style marker for BOR, Pin-style markers or scrap yarn for holding sleeve stitches, tapestry needle for weaving in ends and embroidery, beading needle, seed beads, and sequins for embellishment. Techniques Used: knit, purl, k2tog, kfb (knit front & back), knitting in the round. Embellishment technique video links are included in the pattern. This twee sweater is knit from the collar down.

The body is rejoined and worked to the bottom hem and bound off. Sleeve stitches are then picked up and sleeves are worked to the cuff. The sweater is them embellished as desired. A bunch of options are included in the pattern, but feel free to be creative!
