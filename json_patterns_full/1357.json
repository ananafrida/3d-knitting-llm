  "full_text": "Gnatty enjoys hiking. Long hikes, short meanders, brisk walks in the wind, he does them all. His absolute favourite is multi-day backpacking trips in the snow. As you might expect, finding a sleeping bag to fit a gnome body is a little tricky, what with gnomes coming in so many shapes and sizes. I really want people to play with the gnomes in the book The Gnomes of Grimblewood That’s why half of the gnomes have hats and bodies that can be mixed and matched! So I’ve mixed-and-matched up a gnome for everyone to knit. Gnatty is as excited as I am to see your versions. Are you new to gnoming? I’ve got a playlist of tutorials that covers all sorts of gnome basics, from materials needed, to stuffing, to dealing with ends: Gnome Schooling Materials •Yarn Miss Babs Katahdin 437 (100% Superwash Bluefaced Leicester Wool); 100g/437yd/400m; colours shown: YARN A: gold (Old Gold) YARN B: red (Corset) YARN C: cream (Naked) Approximate Yardage (with a 15% buffer) YARN A: 31yd/28m, approximately 7g YARN B: 74yd/67m, approximately 17g YARN C: 18yd/16m, approximately 4g •Notions yarn needle, stitch markers, 1 removable stitch marker, a beginning of round marker, roving/polyfill stuffing, weighted stuffing like poly pellets/aquarium gravel/dried beans •Needles 2.25mm (US 1, UK 13) and 2.5mm (US 1.5, UK 12/13) needles for working in the round (or size needed to get gauge + one size larger) This pattern has been tech edited.",
