  "description": "The Chevy Chase is a fun scarf pattern playing with working on a bias to create chevron shaped ends on the scarf. This is great for being thrifty and stash busting, you can use 2 left over skeins from a larger project or as many colors as you wish to create a project as unique as you. I was impressed how well the MC striping yarn worked up when paired with an ombre CC. The Wider scarf was made using 3 partial skeins, alternating every color change so all the colors got a chance to play both the MC and the CC. Pattern has an optional fringe you could attach on every odd CC row for added whimsy.",
