  "full_text": "I wanted a gnome pattern knit in the round and TINY because a friend wanted an army of tiny gnomes. This pattern makes a gnome about the height of a AA battery (2” tall, around 5” circumference at the base). Yarn: I used Lion Brand 24/7 cotton in white, red, ecru, and navy. Use any light worsted you prefer. One ball of each will make several gnomes! Needles: I used size 2 (US), 2.75 mm double points Eyes: 5 mm safety eyes, if desired Gauge: gauge does not matter. Just make a tight enough stitch that the stuffing won’t show through. You can use size 0 or 1 (US) needles and fingering yarn if you want to make a particularly tiny gnome. NOTE: My friend decided she wanted her gnomes to have arms. I made a 3 stitch by 3 row i-cord for each arm, leaving a long tail for stitching to the sides.",
