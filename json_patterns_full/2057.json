This is an easy addition to any longie pattern that solves all those problems. You will need a longie pattern to knit this since this is just an addition to any knit in the round longie pattern. This is my first pattern, so if something doesn’t make sense be kind. I do hope you all enjoy it. Error 1/5/12- The medium and large sizes need one additional increase row to match up with the pattern numbers.",
