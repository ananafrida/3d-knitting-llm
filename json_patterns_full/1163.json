  "full_text": "A free, flitty, flighty pattern for you… perfect for summer knitting and a little adornment - for a hat, or a blanket perhaps or just something fun to photograph. Whatever plans you have for yours I hope you have fun knitting and manage to use up some of your lace or 4-ply stash in the process!! This butterfly is knitted as one piece. I haven’t specified any yarn type here although in the pattern I’ve suggested knitting with alpaca 4-ply and kid-silk held together but please feel as free as a butterfly to experiment. I’d love to see your butterflies and moths so please do share #imadethisbutterfly over on Instagram (I’m @dotpbbles_knits) Also, on IG, I am in the process of creating a how-to video should you need it!",
