  "full_text": "Note: I made a different version of this, with a better shape, less knitting and a little trick in the middle to mean no yarn join for the 2nd hart bump. https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/no-sew-heart---c... if you are interested. I wanted a pattern for a stuffable knitted heart that didn’t include “Now knit another and sew them together.” This heart is cast on and knit in the round, from the bottom tip up to the centre V, then split. Each “heart bump” is worked independently and gathered after stuffing. The only sewing is a stitch (or two) in the middle of the V to close the small gap. It knits up quickly and you can alter the size easily by using thicker yarn and bigger needles. There is a clickable link in the PDF to my blog post with more photos. Added some info on knitting the hearts 2 at a time. https://wp.me/pFP2b-4e0 This is a perfect pattern for charity requests. Here in the UK hospitals are asking for knitted heart pairs, to give one to the patient and one to their family, kind of like bonding squares. Knitting the hearts 2 at a time makes sense when you need to make a matched pair!",
