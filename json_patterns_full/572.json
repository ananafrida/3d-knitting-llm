I also have a printable, ad-free version available for purchase on Etsy here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/1454685151/knit-woven-look-t... This stunning blanket has the look of an intricate heirloom woven throw but uses a super simple knitting pattern! There is no need to cut and weave in ends for color changes with this project. It features a light, soft fabric that’s great for the warmer months, and it works beautifully as an eye-catching accent throw. Available in several sizes, this blanket can be admired by anyone – from child to adult! Please note that while my blanket uses Mandala, you can definitely make this with any light or worsted weight yarn that you like! It can be made in a solid color as well and would be stunning.
