  "full_text": "ERRATA: The instructions for the button bands and collar should read “Using smaller needles with RS facing… “ During season 2 of the television show “The Voice,” judge Adam Levine wore a Faroese style sweater which sent the whole twitterverse and blogosphere ablaze with references to his “grandpa sweater.” I remember seeing that episode, and my attraction was immediate, I was obsessed. I replayed the episode several times in freeze frame slow motion to soak in every detail. I loved how the sweater looked very cozy and casual, while still being elegant and carrying an aire of traditional craftsmanship; however, the more I looked at the sweater, the more I saw things that I would want to change if I were to knit one (and it didn’t take me very long to realize that I WOULD be knitting one.) I decided I wanted a more traditional, seamless construction rather than the set in sleeves, and the vertical ribbing on the button bands can stretch and drape oddly -- so I would want to change those, and the small, all-over pattern, while very traditional, was not as interesting as I thought it could be. I imagine that Adam Levine’s sweater was probably hand knit, and bought at an L.A. boutique for about the price of a decent automobile. Luckily for me, I can knit, and could have one without relinquishing a huge pile of cash. I did some research and some swatching and some thinking and came up Streymoy, named after the largest of the Faroe Islands, but chic enough for wherever your travels take you.",
