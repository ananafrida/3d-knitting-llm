  "full_text": "The pattern for these cute knitted Baby Pixie Hats is available on my blog for free in size 0-3 months, 3-6 months and 6-12 months. The hats are made in Drops Nepal, an Aran weight yarn in 35% Alpaca and 65% wool. The yarn is soft and non-itchy. I use 5 mm double pointed needles for the hats. You can make up the colour ways yourself, I tend to make them so they match the colours of my crochet Noella Baby Booties. Please respect copyright and share photos if you make the hats!",
