  "full_text": "Designed for the 2024 games, this pattern is based on “ French Weave ”, a fun easy-to-work stitch, perfect for working while watching the action. Every time the games are on I make some patterns especially for the games - you can find more info about other patterns - here written for DK weight yarn, but you can adjust to use other weights if you like Allow approx. 100m/110yds each of 2 yarns for a single loop Allow approx. 200m/220yds each of 2 yarns for a double loop For the contrast colour you can use variegated or striping yarn for interesting effects. For the main colour you can use light or dark yarn; solid, or even another variegated or striping yarn, just make sure you have good contrast between ALL the colours in the yarns. The cowl is worked as a strip, starting with a provisional cast-on and then kitchenered/grafted together for a seamless finish.",
