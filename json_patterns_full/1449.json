The instructions are for making a bear but it can also be used to make a rabbit by using the ears from my free ‘Teeny Tiny knitted toys’ pattern here: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/teeny-tiny-knitt... The pattern uses only small scraps of yarn and can be quickly knitted up, the assembly is a little fiddly and you can save time by making the dress part a few rows longer and not bothering with making the legs.
