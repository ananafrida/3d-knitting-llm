If you have trouble with clicking on the picture you can use this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQUujoiPpFxYq... NOTE: When I made mine, I only used just under one skein of yarn, but I noticed from notes that a few other people used slightly over a skein of yarn for theirs. I wanted to make a hanging basket for my bathroom for a couple of months now, and noticed I couldn’t find a SINGLE pattern for a knitted hanging basket!! So I made one of my own. This pattern makes a medium to large size basket, you could easily adjust needle size, yarn weight, or just add or take away some extra knitted rows to make it larger or smaller. I used only one skein of bulky yarn! I hope you enjoy. Feel free to email me if you have questions: knitbunny11@gmail.com And take a peek at my website!",
