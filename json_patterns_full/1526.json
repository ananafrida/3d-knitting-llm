  "full_text": "A quick and fun knit worked in soothing garter stitch with a little nod to Shetland hap shaping. Knit this in your favorite Shetland shades, add pops of color in the three needle bind off or at the neck edge! Please enjoy this free pattern and make it your own! Size Circumference: Approx. 20 (25)” / 51 (63.5) cm Depth at Center Front: Approx. 14 (16 ½)” / 35.5 (42) cm See note on gauge below. Needles US 6 / 4mm circular needle, 24” / 60 cm length (a second needle in the same size is needed for the Three Needle Bind Off). Note: You can really use any length of the above needles as no stitches are joined for working in the round. I have listed a length I think is most comfortable for accommodating the number of stitches being worked at one time. Yarn Approx. 200 (300) yds / 183 (275) m of fingering weight yarn. shown in: Jamieson’s Of Shetland Spindrift (100% Pure Shetland Wool; 115 yds / 105m per 25g ball) Samples shown use: Smaller Size- Sunglow + Mogit with Mimosa for front TNBO. Larger Size- Burnt Ochre with Mint for front TNBO and Royal for Purled I Cord Bind off on neck edge. Notions Scrap yarn to hold stitches, 2 split ring markers (to mark RS of knitting, scrap thread can also be used), tapestry needle for weaving in ends. Gauge 21 sts & 36 rows = 4” / 10cm worked flat over Garter Stitch on US 6 / 4mm needles. Note On Gauge: Although gauge is important to aim for there is a lot of flexibility with this project as garter stitch has a lot of give in the fabric. The row gauge is what will determine the circumference of the cowl. The stitch gauge will determine the overall length. It will also make a difference what type of yarn you use. To more easily match the gauge and fabric shown here a woolly and lofty yarn, like Shetland wool, is recommended. Smoother yarns will yield a different result in the fabric. Construction This cowl is worked in two halves and joined at the center front using a Three Needle Bind Off. The two halves are shaped using yarn overs at the beginning of every other row and the top neck edge is worked in a slipped garter stitch edge. The cowl comes in two sizes but can be easily adjusted. The cowl can be worked in a single color or different colors for each half (or more) and contrast pops can be added in the Three Needle Bind Off and/or if you choose to pick up stitches at the top neck edge for a Purled I-Cord Bind Off.",
