Visit the landing page for the afghan’s itinerary, FAQ, and more info here: www.twoofwands.com/travelingafghans ______________________________ Join Lion Brand Yarn and 49 designers and bloggers from seven different countries as we embark on the 2020 “My Life in Yarn” campaign with the Traveling Afghans project! Starting in January, the Traveling Afghans will set sail from NYC and journey to a new designer every two weeks. Each designer will create a 10”x10” square to add to the blanket before sending it off to the next person to add theirs. They will each publish their pattern for free online so YOU can follow along with us and create your own knit or crochet afghan! This year-long collaborative effort will feature stories from the designers about their paths as makers, and will give you the opportunity to learn new stitches and make new friends in the community along the way. Here’s how you can participate: Purchase a yarn kit now for either the knit or crochet Traveling Afghan so you have everything you need to get started with us when the first square pattern is released in January. Note that you do not need to purchase a kit to join - you’re welcome to use any yarn you like, including what you already have in your stash! You’ll need worsted weight yarn and size US 8 (5mm) knitting needles or a J/10 (6mm) crochet hook. Visit the landing page for the itineraries of the afghans along with the master list of all designers and links to their sites so you can follow along as they travel around the world and new patterns get released. Follow the designers on social media to get updates on their pattern releases and learn about their maker journeys. There may even be some giveaways to enter! Host a CAL or KAL with your local maker friends! Get together throughout the year in person or online to add your squares. We would love to see YOUR life in yarn too, so make sure to tag Lion Brand Yarn and My Life in Yarn in your posts and use the hashtags #travelingafghans #lionbrandyarn and #mylifeinyarn and either #travelingknitafghan or #travelingcrochetafghan",
