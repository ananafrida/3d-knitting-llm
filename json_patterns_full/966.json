  "full_text": "You can use any yarn as long as all the colors are of the same yarn weight. 5 to 10 colors depending if you want a color to repeat or not. Gauge is not important in this pattern. You will also need fiberfill to stuff the ball with. If you want to make this into a cat toy, you can insert a jingly ball into the centre of the ball and put the batting all around and sew it shut.",
