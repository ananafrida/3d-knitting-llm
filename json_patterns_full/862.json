  "full_text": "Our October Makers’ League project takes an old favorite into a new era… It’s Easy Does It - Cabled Era! Jeri designed this pattern with a beautiful cable twist up each side. The same easy garter stitch in between. :) I mean, look at that stitch definition! We used a brand-new yarn - Mirasol Chusku. It’s 100% nonsuperwash Corriedale, and everything you could want in a yarn. Beautiful colors, ethically sourced, and outstanding stitch definition. Fun fact: Chusku means “cross-breed” - Corriedale sheep were created by crossing a Lincoln Long-haired sheep with a Merino sheep. Who knew? We LOVE. We know you will too. :) Find the kits here.",
