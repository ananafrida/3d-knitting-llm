  "full_text": "When the winter cold sets in and all the little animals start hibernating, that’s when the Watchlings start their vigil. They make sure everyone stays cosy in their burrow, their food stores stay safe and the spring plants don’t sprout too soon. Why not knit some to keep an eye on things for you this winter? These cute little toys knit up quickly in just one piece, and are a great way to use up your scrap yarn. Watchlings of course love all of the various winter festivities and love to dress in appropriately festive colours so they can join in. The main thing is to play with your yarn and have fun, and in no time you’ll have a whole team of cosy little people to make you smile. This pattern includes instructions for a toy knitted flat, with two small seams to sew at the end and a version knitted in the round, with one small seam to finish. You will need to know how to knit, purl, increase and decrease.",
