  "full_text": "Using circular needles, the doll is knitted from the feet up. She is ten inches tall - if you want her taller, just make the legs longer. Less than one ball of dk is required, plus wool of your choice for the hair. Also toy stuffing. The face can be embroidered however the fancy takes you. She can be made with or without internal pipe-cleaners.",
