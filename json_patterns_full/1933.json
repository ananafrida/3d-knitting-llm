  "description": "This is an any-gauge pattern for frog eyes which can be sewn onto the top of a hat, balaclava, or headband. It’s kind of meant to pair with my old balaclava pattern Freak Out!, which has now been made free, so go grab that and you’ll have everything you need to make a frog mask! Make the Freak Out piece (also designed for any gauge) in green yarn, then use the same yarn for the eyes, along with white, black, and optional red yarns in the same weight.",

Make the Freak Out piece (also designed for any gauge) in green yarn, then use the same yarn for the eyes, along with white, black, and optional red yarns in the same weight. The way this pattern works to get any size eyes with any weight yarn (with no gauge swatch!) is to start at the center of the back side of the eye, work your way outwards until it’s the size you want, then switch to the front-eye colors and work your way inwards, mirroring the back half.",
