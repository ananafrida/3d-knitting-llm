  "full_text": "The EASYPEASY Scarf is a simple triangular scarf that, due to its size, is also ideal as a scarf for cooler days. As the name suggests, the EASYPEASY Scarf is super easy to knit and therefore perfect for beginners. The shawl is knitted crosswise, i.e. starting at the right tip, increasing to the widest point, the middle tip, then decreasing until the left tip is reached. Techniques used: yarn overs, stitches crossed left and right, decreases inclined to the left. Size Length: approx. 220 cm Width (middle tip): approx. 66 cm Measured after washing and stretching. The size of the scarf is variable; depending on your preference, it can also be knitted larger or smaller. Simply knit fewer or more increases until the middle. Stitch sample stockinette stitch with 'Compatible Cashmere' and needle size 3.5 mm: 22 sts x 35 rows = 10 x 10 cm (measured washed). Stockinette stitch with 'Fine Fine Merino' + 'Baby Alpaca Loves Silk' and needle size 4.0 mm: 19 sts x 27 rows = 10 x 10 cm (measured washed). The stitch sample does not have to fit exactly, it serves more as a guide. Needles circular knitting needle 3.5 - 4.0 mm (60 - 80 cm), depending on the yarn used.
