I posted a version of this design over on the Curious Handmade blog some time ago. People loved it so much I decided to turn it into an official pattern in my trademark Percentage Checklist style. So here it is! The Simply Scrappy Cowl is a super relaxing project. It’s ideal for new knitters or anyone who needs a little mental vacation: a bit of ribbing, then straightforward knitting in the round broken up by rows of eyelets. The result is a cosy, adorable cowl that makes the most of any yarn you use. It’s a wonderful stash-buster for those tiny yarn scraps, and it’s also a wonderful “advent yarn calendar” project, if you have bought or made a holiday countdown mini skein set. Because each stripe only uses about 5 grams of yarn, it’s a quicker knit and less of a commitment than your average yarn calendar pattern. And you can make multiple cowls from the same set if you want to whip one up for yourself and then make one or more for gifts! Finished Measurements after blocking Approximately 162cm/64” long, 64cm/25” circumference Yarn 24 x 5g fingering weight mini skeins. Total: 120g (approximately 420m/460yds) of fingering weight yarn Needles 4mm (US6), 60cm (24”) long circular needles (or size to obtain gauge) Notions Removable stitch marker Tapestry needle Gauge 22 sts/30 rows = 10cm (4”) in stockinette stitch after blocking Exact gauge is not critical but may affect the amount of yarn needed if different.",
