  "full_text": "Includes instructions for adjusting size. Inspired by the beautiful embossed leaves sock pattern from Interweave Knits Winter 2005 and Favorite Socks, this baby bonnet has the embossed leaves (“emli” for short) travel down from the top of the hat to a wide brim and delicate picot edge. A fine-gauge cotton yarn is perfect for this lacy summer baby hat. And since there isn’t any typical hat shaping, the pattern is easily adjustable for a different gauge or head size. --From Blue Blog website NOTE: You will need to refer to the magazine or book for the embossed leaves stitch pattern. It is not included in the bonnet pattern.",
