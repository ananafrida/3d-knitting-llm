  "full_text": "Some lovely little pumpkins to decorate your home for spooky season. They are so small that they come together very quickly. Try making some in different thicknesses of yarn and different sizes to make a lovely centre piece for the table, or to decorate a bookshelf or mantle. These little sweeties can be knit in any thickness of yarn, I have done them in sport weight, dk, worsted and bulky. Needle Size Suggestions: Sport – 3.25mm DK – 3.5mm Worsted – 3.75mm Bulky – 4.5mm If you want to work with fingering weight, I would suggest holding it double and work with the needle size suggested for worsted weight. The pattern is written for working with double pointed needles but could be modified to use magic loop. There are two size options, small or large. The small pumpkin has 36 stitches at its widest point, and the large pumpkin has 48 stitches. I am hosting a workshop for making these pumpkins on Tuesday, October 25th at 6pm EST.
