  "full_text": "The Daily Beanie is a classic ribbed hat, sure to be a staple for your fall and winter wardrobe. This beginner-friendly pattern is a super quick project that makes it perfect for gift knitting. The best thing about this hat is that it’s an amazing stash-buster! It is knit in a bulky weight yarn OR equivalent combination of yarn weights held together (for example - 2 strands of worsted, or 2 strands of DK + 1 fingering). I include guidance on choosing different combinations of yarn weights in the pattern.

Note on size choice: Either the short or long length will stretch to fit most adult head sizes, but will change the width of the folded brim. Yarn Choice and Yardage Yardage: Approximately 95-105 (125-145) yards of bulky weight (or equivalent) yarn. The hat is knit in a bulky weight OR equivalent, meaning you can hold different yarn weights together to achieve the same gauge.
