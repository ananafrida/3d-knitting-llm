I read up about them and: From Wiki: ‘… Sloths are a Neotropical group of xenarthran mammals constituting the suborder Folivora, including the extant arboreal tree sloths and extinct terrestrial ground sloths.’ Hmm! Anyway - my little guy is knitted as small as I could in alpaca yarn (just so he/ she has an element of fluffiness, sloths are soo hairy!) You can, of course choose to knit yours with a larger gauge yarn on larger needles, there are some fine faux fur yarns out there! (… just saying/ would love to see someone knit a big one!) He/ she is knitted in one piece - modular, so joining on parts as you go, as with probably all of my ‘today’ patterns. You’ll need some toy safety eyes - my ones are 8mm ones from Etsy And it would be cool to add some wire or even magnets for huggable arms? On this occasion, I did use a wire armature and the instructions on how I did it and what wire I used are all written, with links to where I bought mine, in the pattern. And to end… some more sloth facts: Everything is sluggish and slow-moving, even food digestion. They spend most of their lives hanging in the trees. They are incredibly picky when it comes to pooping. Hey?! Sloths are surprisingly good at swimming - that I didn’t know! Enjoy yours! x",
