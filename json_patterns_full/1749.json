Great for Sunday School lessons (please stitch on eyes rather than using the plastic kind if you are using these with small children); or for anyone who just needs a reminder to be faithful with your offering, and to let God do the rest. I used scrap yarn in my stash for this pattern - one skein of whatever yarn you choose for the bread is likely more than enough. I’m not a professional pattern writer and I’m guessing on yarn quantity! The fish were made out of spare sock yarn I had laying around. These were a little fiddly, but so worth it. I’m sure you can make a large sized set just by using larger needles and more substantial yarn. I’d love to see your projects! Blessings, Jennifer",
