Created with DK and Mohair, it offers the perfect sense of cozy for those cooler months, while not being overbearing or having shawl ends always coming untucked. Quick, simple, yet oh so satisfying. Yarn: You’ll need a full skein of DK (appx 230+ yards) and a skein of Mohair or Suri Silk. If mohair isn’t your thing (or allergies), you can knit it with a single strand of worsted weight yarn. Needles: 20” US6/4mm US6/4mm DPNs (optional) Cable Needle",
