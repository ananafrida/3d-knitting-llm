  "full_text": "Hopefully these felted alphabet blocks will become a favorite toy for whomever they’re made for. To make this project you will do several things: knit, wet felt, needle felt, and sew. If you don’t know how to wet felt or needle felt -- don’t be afraid of this project, its actually quite easy and there will be plenty of time to practice as you’ll be doing those steps multiple times. I’ve done my best to explain each technique (with pictures!) in the pattern, please let me know if you don’t understand something. Enjoy!",
