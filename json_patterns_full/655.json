  "full_text": "’Cos scientists are wizards, no? You can knit it in any colour you want, but green is pretty good. I designed this Hat to support the Scientists March - I won’t be able to march, and this is the least I can do to show solidarity. There are 2 sizes included - 19in (12mth through to small adult) and 22in (average adult female). There are 3 different brim options and 2 different crown options (depending on how much of a point you want to make). And because I want to be as accessible to as many knitters as possible, I’ve included instructions for knitting in the round AND knitting flat. It’s a bumper pattern! I used Manos del Uruguay Wool Clasica as it’s a great woolly chunky yarn that knits up super quick and provides women in Uruguay with social and economic opportunities through the Manos cooperatives. (I’m a big fan of fairtrade yarn, as you know). I’m unable to offer pattern support for my free patterns via Ravelry PM or email - please visit the Wormhead’s Hats group if you have a question about this pattern. Thanks for your understanding!
