  "full_text": "Shamrock - seamróg I love to play with shapes in my knitting and the beauty of increasing and decreasing gives you unexpected wonderful structures. Here’s a little shamrock to celebrate St. Patrick’s day. It is an easy and quick project but the impact is assured! No matter if you turn this into a brooch or an applique, or simply a piece of decoration…once you knit up one, you can’t stop making more. Happy St. Patrick,s Day! CHeck the video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIL6f9BnTbI On the construction This pattern is worked in the round, using the magic loop technique on one long circular needle. The Stitches are divided by the two-needle (N1, and N2). Sizes The sizes are customisable. Changing needle size and yarn weigh you can create as many sizes as you wish. The example is knitted in 4 ply sock yarn, on a 2.5mm (US 2) needle, resulting in a 4cm (1.5inch) shamrock. Yarn For this pattern I used Adriafil Calzasocks, 75% superwash virgin wool, 25% nylon polyamide. 50g skein = 210 m (229 yd). Yarn Requirements MC: 1, 50g ball, Adriafil Calzasocks in Acid Green 34 Tension The tension and gauge is based on the type of needle and yarn you’d decide to use. For this project I will give you the power of NOT SWATCHING!!!! Needles Suggestion 2.5mm(US1.5) Long Circular Needles Notions Darning needle Scissors A brooch backing or a safety pin",
