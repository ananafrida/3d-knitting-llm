  "description": "These mini baskets are knit from the top down, in the round on 2 dpns. The handle is made by knotting the cast on end to its opposite side. To get the lovely woven look (without the pesky purl stitches), simply turn your basket inside out. The pattern is very quick. It only has 5 rounds!",
