  "full_text": "First Seahorse prototype was made in Summer 2024, but the Xmas mini jumpers interrupted the project. Then, I realised that seahorse start from a spherical egg, and got obsessed with knitting spheres. One year later, I eventually came back to my initial project and here we are! About my 2025 patterns The spherical egg pattern was published a few months ago. The idea is to adapt most of the FroggyBug family members so that they can fully hide into the egg and vice versa. From 2025, my patterns are using the same yarn thickness for all parts, including the i-cord strings. If you use a different yarn thickness, your project will just be bigger or smaller than mine, but in the exact same proportions. What has not changed is that I still don’t like sewing and my patterns are as much built-in as possible. Also, to make parts looking neater, I knit most of them in-the-round. Those two technics, built-in and in-the-round sometimes makes the project a bit uncomfortable to hold and progress, this is why I would not recommend my patterns to beginners. Indicative size for suggested yarn from nose to start of the tail: 20 cm (8”) High level process description Seahorse starts from the belly, in garter stitch. There is a slot in, to let the egg in and out. The tail is knit in garter stitch, with some short rows, increases and decreases to add some volume. The two edges are joined together using the 3 needles bind off process. The right side starts with picking stitches from the belly and half of the tail. The tail will join to the body whilst progressing the side. The left side is knit symetrically to the right one. The top of the two sides are joined by knitting the coronet, with 8 spikes matching the ridges. The head is knit in the round, starting from picked up stitches on the neck and the sides. it finishes with the snout which is a 8-st i-cord. An other i-cord is required to support the eyes, and create a little mechanism. To prevent the stuffing to escape to the body from the tail and the head, two internal membranes are knit. A 110-115st spherical egg is made, following separate specific pattern, and attached with an i-cord to the internal back membrane. +++ Notes from Beaunie I found 2 mistakes in the pattern: at page 14 of the seahorse it should be belly instead of neck in the beginning of the detailed instruction of the head and after row 18 it should be the “the 4 lowest stitches” instead of “the 4 top stitches”.",
