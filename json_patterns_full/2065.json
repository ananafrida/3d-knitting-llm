  "full_text": "This “pattern” is actually a blog post with videos and written instructions on how to do this technique, it is not a pattern for a finished item. These videos will help you to create vertical knit stripes which are made one at a time, and connected to each other as they are knit. There are typed directions as well. This technique can be used as an alternate way to join the skirt panels on my Kat Coat pattern. Find Kat on Ravelry , Craftsy , and Etsy It is also used in the adult version ~ the Katherine Coat, which has a planned release for Easter.",
