  "full_text": "I love pretty sock yarn so I buy lots of lovelies and then of course, don’t knit socks with them. So when a shawl is too much, I knit Copilot which is the sister pattern to Autopilot. Equally simple, this design features a garter stitch section separating the mesh for a little structure on a fingering weight (4ply) cowl. It may be adjusted in both length and width according to your taste. The sample (pictured) goes around the neck 3 times and requires 100g of yarn (measures 16cm wide x 180 around). 50g may be used to knit a lovely 1/2 size version.
