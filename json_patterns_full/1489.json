  "full_text": "Description from Knitty.com: Gauge is not critical for this project, but be sure to work at a tight tension to obtain a firm fabric. While shopping for the next perfect handbag to fit my wallet and keys I grabbed my hair and screamed at the store associates to stock more purses for the modern grrls. A retro look in a small size, with a bit of style and \"puff\". So became the Twiggy Tweed bag, I picked up my trusty Domo-kun topped US #7 needles and the cool new Plymouth Tweed, in two nights I finished my purse and went back to those stores to laugh at the prices of their fugly pleather bags.",
