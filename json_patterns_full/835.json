  "full_text": "“The nets were overflowing In the Gulf of Mexico” from “Refuge of the Roads” by Joni Mitchell A long skinny scarf with a rustic garter stitch chevron, inspired by a favorite song. The scarf is worked with two strands held together. I worked with relatively short lengths of yarn, splicing in a new color when necessary, generally holding a dark and light shade together, sometimes holding two darker colors together. The pattern can also be worked in a more varied palette to use up more varied scraps. Knit on 5mm/US8 needles with approximately 60g/280yds/260m of leftover yarns including Jamieson’s of Shetland Spindrift and some merino silk mixes. If you are working with one strand of a heavier yarn, allow approximately 140yds/130m. Dimensions: approximately 4.75ins/12cm wide by 46ins/117cm Gauge: approximately 19sts (measured on the diagonal) and 22 rows (measured along the spine) = 4ins/10cm in pattern",
