  "full_text": "updated in august 2025 This Pippi Långstrump inspired sweater pattern is a simple drop shoulder design with beginner-friendly stranded colourwork. It is knit top down and in the round, and you can flexibly choose a size with your preferred amount of ease. Tag me and #pippipullover on instagram so I can see your creations! If you are having any trouble with the pattern, you are welcome to email me or message me over there too. Happy knitting! Sizing Sizes: 1 (2) 3 (4) 5 (6) 7 (8) 9 To fit bust circumference: 75-95 (85-105) 95-115 (105-125) 115-135 (125-145) 135-155 (145-165) 155-175 cm Finished measurements: Body circumference: 118 (126) 135 (146) 155 (166) 175 (186) 195 cm Back width: 65 (70) 75 (81) 86 (92) 97 (103) 108 cm Length: 59 cm (adjustable) Yoke depth: 22 (22.5) 22.5 (24) 25 (25.5) 27 (28) 28.5 cm Sleeve length: 45 cm (adjustable) Sleeve circumference: 44 (51) 53 (58) 62 (67) 71 (78) 80 cm This is a very roomy sweater, so each size will fit quite a wide range of bust circumferences. The sweater can be worn with between 20 and 40 cm positive ease comfortably, hence the wide ‘to fit’ ranges. Just note that the amount of ease at the shoulders will impact your sleeve length. For reference: my sample is size 2 and has 40 cm positive ease on me. Gauge 18 sts x 27 rows on 5mm needles = 10x10 cm Make sure to include a colourwork section in your swatch as some knitters need to go up a needle size for their colourwork sections.
