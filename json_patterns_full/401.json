  "description": "This little Christmas Bauble is knitted two-stranded in the round on dpns. The motif depicts two pine trees with the numbers 2025 central on the bauble, and it has a ribbon attached to the top for hanging. For these I’ve used fibre filling, but you may also knit around a plastic or glass bauble.",

  "full_text": "This little Christmas Bauble is knitted two-stranded in the round on dpns. The motif depicts two pine trees with the numbers 2025 central on the bauble, and it has a ribbon attached to the top for hanging. For these I’ve used fibre filling, but you may also knit around a plastic or glass bauble. The pattern is both written and charted. It uses kfb, m1r, m1l (but other increases may be used), and k2tog/SSK for decreases. The pattern is written for dpns, but if you’re more comfortable knitting on magic loop, that’s works too. Size: Height: 6.5 cm/2.5” Circumference: 20 cm/8” Gauge: 32 sts per 10 cm/4” Materials: Yarn: Light Fingering (210 m per 50 gr) in two colours. Approx. 5 grams of each colour. Dpns size 2.5 mm (or circulars) Fibre filling (or bauble approx. 6 cm diametre) Darning needle Yarn suggestions: Arwetta by Filcolana, Flora by Drops, Schachenmayr Sockenwolle 4-ply",
