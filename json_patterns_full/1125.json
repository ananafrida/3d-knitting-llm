  "full_text": "These mini dolls are only about 3” - 3½” high. They are based on the Duduza Comfort Dolls made for Africa. I knitted lots of these a few years ago. “Duduza” is a Zulu word for “comfort”. These knitted dolls are given in the hope that they bring comfort to AIDS/HIV-affected children in sub-Saharan Africa. Recently they have become popular again, and often known as Izzy Dolls. Requirements: DK yarn ~ small amounts of different colours 3.25mm or 3.5mm needles Polyester stuffing This smaller sized version is perfect for little hands to hold. So cute.
