Visit the landing page for the pattern release schedule, FAQ, and more info here: www.twoofwands.com/zodiac-icons-blanket-kal ______________________________ This year-long mystery knit-along will consist of twelve colorwork knit square patterns, each representing a different zodiac icon, released one by one at the start of each astrological season to form a full blanket at the end of the year. I’ve teamed up with my long-time friend and astrologer, Ramona Sidlo, to help guide us on this cosmic journey. She will teach us all about astrology and offer insight and direction to help us set our intentions and capitalize on the gifts and opportunities the year ahead will offer. As always, Lion Brand Yarn will provide the kits. We will be working with Hue + Me as the mix-and-matchable 30-color palette will allow endless color combinations to represent your astrological chart or your home decor. At the end of the project you will have a gorgeous, meaningful blanket to display in your home or gift to a loved one. Here’s how you can participate: Patterns: The patterns will be released one by one at the start of each astrology sign, beginning with Virgo on 8/23.
