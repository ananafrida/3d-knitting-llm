  "full_text": "Yeah - because the world totally needs another Christmas ornament pattern… A simple sphere pattern with notes on how to personalise. Currently only for 7 cm ornaments, but I am working on other sizes… Update: I have added a chart for 1/8 off the ball, just in case you want to get your crayons out… Update November 2014: I have uploaded another file with additional charts. Please read more about the design here: http://www.ravelry.com/projects/braindead/balls-up--2 Update December 2020: Apparently this pattern is offered for sale online; please note that this is NOT me and NOT authorised; the pattern is and shall remain free, and I hope nobody has been duped into paying for it. Happy Holidays!!!",
