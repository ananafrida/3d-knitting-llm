If by chance ye’ve still got both yer legs, and two whole hands, and two good eyes - wait a minute! What kind of a pirate be ye?!? Ah, well…we’ve all gotta start swashbucklin’ somewheres, and it takes some time sailin’ the seas afore ye can earn the markin’s of a true pirate. ‘Til then, ye can fake it in gran’ style wi’ this classic eye patch! Knittin’s a fittin’ pastime for those dull moments between lootin’ and plunderin’, and this pattern’s easy to follow, so there’s no excuses for slackin’ off here! So, pick up yer pointy sticks, grab that wad of wool, and cast on, while singin’ Yo Ho! Yo Ho! A Pirate’s Life fer Me!“",
