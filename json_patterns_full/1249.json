  "full_text": "Harold is a tubby little mouse with a smart fair isle jumper. Knitted with a small amount of shetland yarn in 5 colours he is made in two pieces (base and upper) and then seamed, but is easily converted into a seamless knit - you’ll just need to sew on the ears and tail. Fill him with beans for added gravitas and he’ll make a lovely door stop. Written instructions with a chart for the colourwork.",
