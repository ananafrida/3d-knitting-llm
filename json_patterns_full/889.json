  "full_text": "Knitting Badge Neckerchief This cute little garter neckerchief is a must have for summer, or when you just want to feel like you are in the scouts. The Knitting Badge Neckerchief can easily be whipped up in one sitting, although you could make it any size you want and if you make it really large it might not be that quick. Use cotton or linen yarn for a cute summer accessory or wool for a little neck warmer for early spring and autumn. Knit this with any yarn and on any size needles, following the simple repeat until you get a size you’re happy with. The samples made on 2,5mm needles work perfectly to tie around your neck and the one made on 4mm needles look great with a small ring to keep it in place. Yarn and tools Grab whatever yarn you want Grab any needle size that makes you happy See the details of the samples as examples. 2 x stitch markers 1 x tapestry needle for weaving in ends Samples (see image with 4 samples) Pink scarf (right) Needles: 4mm Yarn: Sandnes Line 53% Cotton, 33% Viscose, 14% Linen Meterage 34g / 75m Size after blocking: 80 cm x 25 cm 4 repeats before the last garter stitch section Beige Scarf (bottom) Needles: 2,5mm Yarn: Järbo Bambu Raggi 50% wool, 25% polyamide, 25% bamboo Meterage 22g / 90m Size after blocking: 65x21 cm 5 repeats before the last garter stitch section Beige scarf (top) Needles: 2,5mm Yarn: Isager Hør – 100% linen Meterage 25g / 90m Size after blocking and wear: 88x28 cm 5 repeats before the last garter stitch section Note: this yarn stretched out a bit more when tying around my neck several times.
