  "full_text": "Short socks are the bane of my existence because they always fall down into my shoes. A lot of commercially-made socks prevent this with grippy silicone strips on the inside but that doesn’t help when it comes to knitting your own socks. So, I have been on a quest to figure out how to knit no-show socks that don’t fall down after a few steps and I think this is the answer! This “pattern” is only for the cuff and heel tab of the sock and is meant to be used with a flap and gusset heel. You can pair it with your favorite vanilla pattern or even with a patterned sock - just start the patterning after you pick up the gusset stitches for the heel. (Don’t have a favorite vanilla pattern? Try mine - it’s free! )",
