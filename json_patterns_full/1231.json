Just give one to somebody and say, “hey, this silly little thing made me smile and I thought it might make you smile, too.” Because in the end, I don’t think anyone ever wished they hadn’t spent so much time on being kind. Now also available in German thanks to user raeubertoechterch. Thank you Martina! Note: This pattern was previously only available as an in-the-round pattern, but as of March 2021 it has been updated with the option to knit flat on two needles.",
