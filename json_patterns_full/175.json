  "full_text": "’Worry Worms’ are small, wiggly worms that are used as a tool for emotional support, stress relief, and to help children or adults cope with their worries. They are often given with a poem - and are designed to be held when a person is feeling anxious or upset. The trend started in the UK and spread through social media, particularly through online crafting groups like Random Acts of Crochet Kindness on facebook. Most Worry Worms are crocheted - but I have been asked to write a version for those who prefer to knit. So…….. I accepted the challenge …….. I am always happy to have a go! These are fiddly to knit - I admit it. To get the curly body, you have to kfbfb into each stitch. That is ~ knit into the front, the back, the front and the back of the stitch - making 4 stitches out of each stitch. It is a bit slow, but if you are as determined as I am - why not have a go!? Requirements: DK yarn – cotton or cotton blend DK works especially well (I do not recommend hairy or fuzzy yarn) 4mm needles Googly eyes (optional) – you can embroider on the eyes if you prefer Perfect for charity donation , Random Act of Kindness, or a sweet little fun gift.
