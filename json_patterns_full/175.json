  "full_text": "A miniature bag from small things. I designed it for a social knitting challenge and just wrote the pattern down in a few words. You may chose a different yarn weight and needle size to make a bigger or smaller bag. Size Width: 10 cm (4 inch) Depth: 6 cm (2 1/3 inch) Height: 7 cm (2 3/4 inch) For a full size bag Do your math, increase the percentage of stitches and rows equally. If you double the amount of sts casted on, double the rows knitted as well, then the bag will be double the width and height. For the sides divide the sts picked up from the sides by 3 and the middle 1/3 is the bottom and they are the sts you knit for the sides. The buttonhole will be the same size. The flap is knitted as in the pattern.",
