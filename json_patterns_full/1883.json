  "full_text": "Looking for a toe that hugs your foot like a glove on your hand? Look no further! Initially, I designed this toe to fit my foot. After getting quite a bit of interest on the design, I decided to create a pattern that should work for every foot size out there. In all transparency, this pattern is actually more of a formula. There is a little bit of math involved but nothing too scary. If you can add, subtract, multiply and divide, you will be just fine :) This pattern can be used for any sock size or pattern you can think of. A word of warning though: because this pattern is designed to create a specific right and left foot toe, you may have to alter the sock pattern you are incorporating this toe into. Have comments? I would love to hear from you! Are you on Instagram? If you use the pattern, tag your awesome project with #toesbyterry and show us!!
