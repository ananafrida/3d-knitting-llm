  "full_text": "This is the third in a series of twelve linked patterns for a knitted wreath, to be published daily in December 2013. This pattern is for two sizes of oak leaves, each with their own acorns. The big leaves are about 9 cm long and the small ones just under 8 cm. They are knitted in brown DK weight yarn; 20g of yarn will make eight big leaves and 10g will make the same number of small leaves. Small amounts of two shades of lighter brown yarn are used for the acorns. All my ravelry patterns are free to download but, if you enjoy them, please consider making a donation to the British Liver Trust where the money will go to fund research and support the families of children with a liver disease. You can do this easily by going to my fundraising page here Happy Knitting!",
