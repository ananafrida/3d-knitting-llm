  "full_text": "This pattern is perfect to use up any scraps of yarn you have laying around. The tree measures 2.5” tall when completed and yardage noted in Ravelry is approximate. Materials: Two strands of fingering weight yarn or 1 strand of worsted weight yarn, approximately 3 grams Double-pointed needles or circular needles (magic loop) Size 4mm (US 6) recommended (or smaller if you are a loose knitter) Removable stitch marker Darning needle to weave in ends A wine cork Yarn suggestions: Use one strand of worsted weight or two strands of fingering weight yarn held together. Perfect for those mini-skeins or leftovers. This would probably work with DK as well, just be mindful of the circumference of the base (which you can tighten up around the cork after knitting and weaving in ends).",
