  "full_text": "English version now available. Some time ago there were a lot of wonderful women in the wool tit lovers club who each knitted one or more of these patches. These patches became a wonderful blanket that was intended to give one of us a lot of strength and comfort in a difficult hour. My dear woolly tit lovers, it is wonderful to be a part of this group, especially in these moments. Because when one of us is feeling bad and needs comfort and strength, there is always someone there for her, like now again. This patch madness started when one member of our group was facing a difficult and demanding time in her live. Our wonderful group wanted to send her a little bit of strength and good thoughts. So many members knitted each one or two of these patches. They were then seamed together also by a group of our members. Since then the group knitted blankets and pillows for our members who needed strength or for little babies which were expected by members of our group. Thank you veryone from the Wollmeisenlovers Club, you really are the best and I am proud to be a part of this.",
