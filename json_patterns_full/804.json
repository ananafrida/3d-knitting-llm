SKILL LEVEL: Intermediate: This pattern is for those who feel comfortable with knitting and have made a few projects, using various skills and techniques. Skills/concepts include knitting in the round, German Short Rows, and mosaic colorwork. Notes from the Designer: The slip stitch patterns in this sweater provide for a lot of texture, with minimal effort. The knitter needs only to work one color at a time to achieve the intricate looking yoke and sleeve detailing. Utilizing the slip stitch pattern along the sides creates a slight curve to the hem. Designed to fall just below the high hip, this sweater may easily be altered to any length. The construction is top down, beginning with an integrated neckband. German Short Rows are used to shape the neckline, followed by the mosaic yoke. Here, the knitter should check that they have a good fit, and then divide the stitches to complete the remainder of the body. Returning to the on-hold stitches, each sleeve is completed individually. Click here to watch a video that gives tips for making this pattern its best. Making a gauge swatch is critical to achieve the desired results. Please DO NOT assume that you knit to the same gauge as I do! Yes, it is an extra step, but it also ensures that what you are knitting will produce what you expect. Also, you won’t need to worry about running out of yarn. If you are substituting yarn, it is especially important to verify that it behaves in the same way as the yarn called for in the pattern. The German Short Row method is used to shape the back neckline. For all slip stitches, insert needle as if to purl with yarn in back (unless noted otherwise). When working mosaic (slip stitch) colorwork, be sure to slip stitches with yarn held loosely in back of work to prevent puckering. Spreading the stitches out on the right needle helps with this. Knitting colorwork in the round can often cause a “jog” at the point of color change. Slipping the first stitch can help to correct the jog. This method has been included when beneficial.
