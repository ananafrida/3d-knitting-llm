  "full_text": "Like this pattern? I volunteer at the Loose Ends Project, and I’d love it if you’d consider a small donation to help them match volunteer crafters like myself to families with unfinished projects left behind due to disability, illness or loss of a loved one! This pattern is a collaboration with the Hamilton Fibre Forge in Ontario, Canada. It was designed to showcase the different type of yarns one might find at a small scale fibre festival - from small batch farm yarns to indie dyed gradient sets, this quick and easy pattern will work with them all! It’s a triangular shawl, knit from the top left corner and worked diagonally to the lower right edge. A simple combination of stockinette and garter stitch are accented by an interesting lace pattern and twisted stitches. This pattern includes both charts and written instructions, and features a “knit until you run out of yarn” style construction, that provides notes on sizing up. Two suggested sizes are illustrated, using two different yarns. En dansk version findes her. https://strikkeglad.dk/54743/tekstursjal/",
