  "full_text": "It all started with the Year of Mittens back in 2016, then came the Year of Hats, followed by Gifts, and last year’s Bulky Hats. Now in honor of our 15th Anniversary, we’re sharing a Season of Sweaters. The Season of Sweaters features four free patterns perfect for the changing of the seasons. Patterns are designed by Kate and Courtney and will be published on the first Friday of spring, summer, fall, and winter and feature four Kelbourne Woolens yarns . How about a kit? Grab it from us here or ask for one at your favorite LYS! Worthy of Note The Summer Sweater is worked from the top down and features modified raglan shaping based on Elizabeth Zimmermann’s Hurry-Up Last Minute Sweater (also called the December Sweater), from her book Knitter’s Almanac. The raglan increases are worked every round, using yarnover increases on odd-numbered rounds, followed by either (p1, k1) or (k1, p1) in each yarnover on the following even-numbered round. After working the neck ribbing, the set-up round marks a single stitch at both center front and center back, and the remaining stitches are reserved for the sleeves. The raglan increases are worked at each end of the front and back sections every round, inside the markers. After completing the yoke, the lower body is worked in the round down to the lower edge which is finished with k2, p2 ribbing. The held stitches of the sleeve openings are finished with k2, p2 ribbing in the round. Specifications YARN Kelbourne Woolens Mojave (60% cotton, 40% linen; 185 yds/50 gm skein): smoke gray 046; 4 (4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7) skeins.
