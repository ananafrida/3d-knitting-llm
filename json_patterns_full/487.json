This project was designed as a two-skein project to make the most of her gorgeous yarns. This unisex cowl is deep, featuring a simple stitch pattern to show off subtle color variations. A point at the bottom creates a “kerchief” look, and includes an optional tassel. You can find Mindful Folk Fiber here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/MindfulFolk",

You can find Mindful Folk Fiber here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/MindfulFolk While the larger worsted weight pink version uses Mindful Folk yarn, the smaller sport weight green version features another very special yarn: Cashmere People Cashgora Sport. It uses only one skein of this incredible soft, hand spun and hand dyed yarn. This yarn has a very special story as it is ethically sourced, spun and dyed by women in Tajikistan and Afghanistan.
