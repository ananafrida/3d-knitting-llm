  "full_text": "Construction Fairisle Friends are knit in one piece from the bottom-up. Simple sewing techniques are used to define the arms and legs after knitting. Fast and fun to knit, these dolls are designed to be sturdy, safe, and perfect for even the littlest hands to hold. Gauge Exact gauge is not important. I recommend choosing a needle 2 or 3 sizes smaller than listed on the ball band to create a dense fabric that will keep the stuffing hidden. * Use a larger needle for stranded knitting if needed to maintain gauge. Yarn Models are knit from a variety of DK oddments. Abbreviations CO = cast on;; K = knit; K2tog = Knit 2 stitches together; P = purl; RS = right side; St(s) = stitch(es); WS = wrong side Skills Required I designed these dolls as practice projects to improve my own stranded knitting skills. There are many excellent tutorials on stranded knitting and knitting from a chart available online.",
