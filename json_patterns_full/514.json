It is perfect for produce or as a gift bag. It is loose and stretchy, so will hold a surprising amount. This pattern is very forgiving, tension is not important as the bag is made to be very loose and stretchy. It uses a 3-needle bind-off, but a normal bind-off can be used and the bottom of the bag sewn together if preferred. The pattern calls for 4-ply yarn, but will work with any light-weight yarn, perfect for using up scraps!",
